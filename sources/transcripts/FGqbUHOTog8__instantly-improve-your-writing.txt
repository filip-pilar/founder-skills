We always talk about write with an eraser because oftentimes if you want to make what you're
writing good and clear, you need to just cut out a bunch of extraneous things, a bunch
of things that don't matter.
So a lot of times, have you guys heard of the principle inversion?
Charlie Munger, the right-hand man of Warren Buffett often talks about this.
He said, this actually helped me a lot later last year, oftentimes when you want to do
something you always think about I got to do all these things in order to
achieve that but the best thing to do oftentimes is to figure out what not to
do so like if you want to do something more like if you want to write more then
there are all kinds of stuff that you should just stop doing right that won't
distract you so this is not from your example but we've been trying to hire a
video producer and this is one applications take a moment to look at
this can you read it also if you're like nah I don't even want to read this don't
read it that's actually a really good response as well oh everybody says it
fills chat GBT let's do a practice in I must say I this isn't good but it's not
necessarily terrible right this is like a first draft and this person obviously
Obviously, he has some experience, and I think that if this person were to take a little bit more time,
it could be much stronger, right?
So let's do this exercise then.
Let's just start erasing.
You will see that once you start erasing things, it will be better.
All right, what should we erase?
Okay, somebody said diverse, so let's just erase this.
Okay, okay, so two people said delete, hold.
What else should we erase?
This one?
Basically, you're saying just start over.
Wow, you guys are harsher critics than I am.
Go ahead.
I would not write.
It's not something I would like to.
So at this point, hey, let's just collab.
Yeah.
I'm going to give you, I rewrote this.
And I'm going to give you my take.
Now you're going to think, oh, well, Jeff is writing a very Jeff
Buildspace way.
Yes, but I think that actually just kind of shows,
if you're doing anything created at Buildspace,
you kind of need to understand where we're coming from, right?
So take a moment to read this.
So let me read you this.
Damn, I really like the content Bill Smith is putting out
there, it's really fresh take on what education is.
So I'm kind of establishing like, I at least have some
context what you're doing, right?
And then this part.
To be honest, I'm inspired to ditch everything I got going
on in the past to work with y'all.
My work with startups, traditional broadcast TV, media,
for ads, livestream, et cetera, I know people won't read
that, but I know they'll read, none of that matters.
You understand what I did there?
I'm showing that I already have all these experience.
By setting a different way, I'm saying that
all of this experience, actually,
I'm willing to learn what you guys do
because I'm reinforcing,
I think you guys do a fresh take,
so for me to join you, it should be fresh, right?
You're doing something new and I want to be part of it,
just to kind of reinforce that.
Check out three things I made in the past I'm proud of
and I think you'll like too.
Hit me up for a chat.
And then at the very end,
This also shows that I study what Bill Spitz is doing,
and I'm like, your YouTube sucks,
so I'm going to help you do with your YouTube, right?
So this at least makes it seem like,
yeah, it's a quick no or quick yes based upon the links.
How many of you know Sticker Mule?
Yeah, yeah, what do you think of their ads?
They're pretty good.
Yeah, yeah.

Anthony, co-founder of Sicker Mule.
P.S. New Joe Tomorrow.
I'm like, this is sick.
Like, so again, I'm sure that Anthony could have written
something that is a thousand words long,
but this hits hard, right?
Look at this one, right?
Why is this one good?
I'm just gonna read this out loud.
Three months ago, I bought a business making $500 per month for $4,000 on Acquire.com.
So he immediately says, I bought a business for making $500 per month.
And then he says, it's now worth $100K and made $4,000 last month.
How many of you are already interested in how you did this?
Yeah, almost, I mean, almost everybody, right?
I also love what he did here.
Disclaimer, please try this at home.
Like, I feel a sense of trust that this was a thread.
I know that when I click in, it's gonna give me little chunks of stuff that just makes
me happy when I read it.
Any questions on clear and understandable?
Good?
Let's move on to me.
