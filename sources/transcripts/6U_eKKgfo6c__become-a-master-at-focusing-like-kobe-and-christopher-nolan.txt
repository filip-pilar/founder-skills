I want to start with an example.
Who knows who this is? Raise your hand. Christopher Nolan.
This is Christopher Nolan.
Christopher Nolan has directed probably a majority of the blockbuster hits that you all know today,
from The Dark Knight to Inception to Interstellar.
Danilo Oppenheimer, right? So he's just really good, right?
And he's seen as one of the best directors of all time, for me at least.
And he's also one of my favorite founders of all time.
Just like a side note, he runs this company called Syncopy,
and that's the company that makes all his movies.
And a lot of you also don't know this,
but Syncopy just has nine people who work there.
So all of Nolan's movies, from Oppenheimer to everything else,
they're made by a company that employs nine people
full time at least.
And of course movies are giant productions,
but it's pretty cool how he's able to do these crazy,
massive things with such a small amount of people
while actually working for him full time.
Pretty cool.
Now at the end of the day,
he probably employs like 500 to 1,000 people on set
at a given moment,
but those are like sprints, right?
It's like for four to six months he has those people,
then it's all over.
Anyways, that's just more of a fun fact.
I wanna kind of show a clip of two actors,
who you may recognize,
talking about working with Christopher Nolan,
because it's kind of interesting.
There's nothing to be hamletary about Chris.
He's like, all right, we're gonna do this.
Everything's very British and very calm.
There's no chaos.
And even when he's happy, he goes, yeah, yeah, happy.
All right, we're gonna do that.
Everything is very normalized,
and he creates a normalized environment for everyone.
So everyone's got kind of wings of freedom the whole time.
Yeah, it's very, nobody's pulse ever gets raised on him.
It's very, very cool.
So it's kind of crazy to hear an actor actors talk about director like that because you can imagine being on set of a film is fucking
It must be insane, right?
And there must be an insane amount of like
Unknowns right that have to be dealt with constantly
But I think what's interesting is from the outside Christopher Nolan extremely focused guy right like when he's on set making these movies
it feels like he's just, he knows what he's doing.
And I think that's true, right?
Like you have to kind of, like think about it,
when you're making a movie and you're on set
with like hundreds of people spending millions of dollars
a day or at least a week, and you're doing stuff like,
movies like these, right, that a lot of us recognize today,
like you can't actually, like there's not even a moment
where you cannot be focused, right?
Like the game is set up where like,
he cannot have an off hour, let alone an off day,
Right? So yeah, you just, there's no time to waste.
But that's like kind of the nature of producing a film, right?
Where it's those really three to six really hyper focused months,
sometimes longer in post production, maybe a year, two years.
But yeah, every single day the movie's not out, you're wasting money, right?
And in this case it's his own company, so it's his own money.
Be bad, right? There's literally no time to mess around.
That's like the game he's playing.
But I think we don't see, at least for this guy,
we don't see all those moments that led to those focused
like three months, right?
For example, you can argue that Oppenheimer was made
in six months, right, like end to end.
But then you don't actually think about, oh, like this script,
how many years did that take?
Well, the man's been messing with the script
for like four years.
Okay, so like, sounds like he spent four years
messing with the script on and off, right?
You probably don't see him and Hans Zimmer
or whatever composer he's working with in the studio,
months before they even have the script,
or months before the script, or maybe like,
yeah, essentially you don't see them essentially
just messing around with new music and new sounds, right?
Trying to get new ideas for what the film
could look like and feel like.
Because a lot of that's already finalized
by the time you get on set, right?
You know, you don't see, you know,
nowadays Christopher Nolan and IMAX is a really big deal,
but you don't see all the times that he fucked around
with IMAX since 2005, since Batman Begins.
Nowadays, IMAX is a big deal.
People love 70 millimeter, but dude's been messing around
with it since 2005 or whatever year Batman Begins came out.
So he's played a lot with his tools.
So such that when he comes on set, yeah,
he is very focused when he gets on set.
But what's cool is the guy goes hard,
but only on something he knows he can go extremely hard on.
It's not like he's thinking it's gonna flop.
there's like a high chance it'll flop when he's on set
because again, you can't afford that.
So yeah, when kind of those actors set, it's very calm,
you know, it's very British, they say.
It's interesting because it's like,
yeah, I mean, to him, it's just routine.
He's already thought through this
like probably hundreds of times,
such that when he gets on set for those three months,
he's just locked in, right?
But again, we don't see all of this stuff.
So we just see the final part,
we just see the man possessed working on the film.
We don't see like the four years, five years
I took him to write Inception, et cetera, right?
Or the years that he spent just messing around
with the cameras probably at his house.
And yeah, when you see him at work,
it's like a man with all the answers.
And it's like, you're just jealous.
You're like, oh my God, the guy's so focused.
Damn, I wish I could find that level of focus in my work,
in my life even, that'd be amazing.
But it's interesting, he just knows all the answers.
And he feels like one of the best directors in the world.
Another example, you know, just like,
I use a lot of sports, I'm actually not really
into sports, by the way, but I love kind of,
sports examples and just mental, like, parallels to sports.
This is Kobe, right?
Like, exactly same, if you think about it,
very, very similar.
One of the greatest basketball players of all time.
And yeah, from the outside,
this dude's extremely focused, right?
I think when most of us think about Kobe Bryant,
even if we're not into basketball,
we probably think of him as like a very,
kind of locked in player that needs to win the game, right?
Like, that's what he's kind of known for.
And yeah, even on the, even off the court,
he has a, if you know about Kobe Bryant,
Massive reputation for just being insanely driven
and insanely locked in to the point where,
yeah, he can be like a dick to work with sometimes.
And he can be like, he can ask a lot of people around him.
But had a reputation for just being locked in all the time.
But, and I think you actually have to be pretty locked in
because he's doing stuff like this, right?
I mean, the stuff like this isn't just random.
This is in a giant stadium in an actual regular season game
and he just goes for it.
Now, when we look at this, you know,
it's not just him messing around.
Like, he's probably done that before.
He's probably thought about that.
He didn't probably just go for it.
Maybe some of it's feel,
but he's just developed so much feel then
over the course of many years
that he can just do these things on the fly.
And he feels very, like, he just feels like,
yo, where do you get that answer from?
Like, that's insane.
So yeah, during the game,
you can't second guess yourself, right?
Again, you have four quarters in basketball.
What is that, 12 minutes a quarter?
Not much time, right?
You have to perform and you have to kind of like
know what you're going in with.
So again, with Kobe Bryant, we don't see him doing this
for like, what is it, like hundreds of hours, right?
At the end of the day, I don't know how many shots
this guy's taken in his life before he passed, right?
He just keeps on shooting.
This is after a game, by the way, he lost.
He's just shooting, just countless,
countless amounts of shots.
And you know also what's interesting to think about is like,
oh, he's probably practicing certain types of shots.
He's probably not just doing random shit, right?
He's probably practicing something very specific
that he's thinking about.
So even the way he's practicing is actually pretty focused.
And yeah, during the game, guy goes hard.
And I think we see that in a lot of his past games.
But I think what's cool is he actually mostly sticks
to a plan.
So in basketball, in many sports, you stick to a plan, right?
You have some sort of structure that you follow.
And yeah, that plan is kind of like,
It can change sometimes in a given moment,
but for the most part, you've got a plan
and you're locked in, right?
Because if you don't lock in, if he's sitting there like,
oh man, this play sucks, oh man, what are we doing?
All of a sudden, his mind's there,
his mind's not on the game, right?
Which he has to play for these four quarters.
And then there's me.
I'm not Kobe, I'm not Nolan, and I'm very openly,
I'm like, I don't have that level, I'm not at that level,
right, maybe it will get there in 20 to 30 years,
right now, I'm definitely at that level.
And I think that you all should know,
like as you can talk about this, I'm still learning this.
I'm probably much closer to you all right now
in terms of like, in terms of like my own level of focus.
Like I'm not, I'm probably not that far
from a lot of like just people like,
I think I kind of bucket myself in terms of focus
with a lot of you all.
Now I'm probably somewhat better,
maybe not, but not that much better.
Like these guys are like way better, right?
They are ridiculous.
Like Christopher Nolan, that little focus is ridiculous.
Kobe Bryant, to spend a year of your life training
12 hours a day, 16 hours a day, that's ridiculous.
And to have faith, that level of faith,
that level of patience, it's very difficult.
Yeah.
So like for Nolan and for Kobe,
they have like, I'm gonna say,
like practice mode and then like game time.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
When Christopher Nolan's on set,
like in the movie, that's it.
Like he'd lost.
Game time, yeah.
Like how did that, like what did that for us?
Yeah, that's a great question.
I'm gonna answer that in a bit.
But the question was like, hey, Kobe and Nolan have game time.
And then practice time.
What about us, right?
Maybe some of you all just feel like you're locked in in game time all the time.
Well, that's probably a problem, right?
But I'll talk about that in a second.
If you still have a question, we'll cover it.
Just for context on me, I think maybe a lot of you can relate.
Growing up, a lot of people would, I would have this quote said to me a lot,
where I'd always be doing something new.
And I would always get the response, oh, Parza.
Or my friends, when we present.
they presented, what is it this time?
You know?
And they were always like, oh, what is it this time?
What do you got this time?
Oh, what are you selling now?
What are you making now?
Like that was always my reputation, right?
So from the outside, people always saw me as like hyper-unfocused
and just constantly off the walls all the time.
But I didn't feel that way, to be honest, during that moment.
But I'll talk about that in a sec.
Learned a lot over the years.
And I think I wanna go through a couple of things
that have just worked for me right now.
And I think it's worth just starting on a single point,
right?
I think all of us can agree here that doing great things
requires focus.
I don't know if anyone disagrees with this statement.
I'd be pretty interested to hear the take.
But I think no matter what, when we see great things,
I don't just mean for the world.
Like if you want to be a great son, a great brother,
like that requires focus.
If you want to be a great partner to someone,
a great pet owner, shout out Marengo,
you gotta have great focus.
So again, and of course now making music, building products, blah, blah, blah.
These things require even greater focus actually.
But all great things require focus.
And I think that for a long time I was very,
very obsessed with this kind of like, is the word idyllic?
Idyllic version of focus where it was like hyper insane focus on one clear vision and path.
Like I always felt like bad that I didn't have that for like the longest time.
And I was kind of obsessed with getting that.
And I was like, what's wrong with me?
Like, why don't I have that?
Like, Christopher Nolan has that,
or like XYZ person has that.
The guy who runs Airbnb has that,
what's wrong with me, you know?
And yeah, for a long time,
I was kind of locked in in this mentality.
I think for a long time,
it was kind of thinking a lot about this guy
and this guy's company.
It's like, damn, like, he was focused as hell
and made the iPhone.
How did he get there?
Like, obviously it took a long time.
Obviously it took like a lot of team effort.
You wanna hold on to him?
Ahmed, you wanna hold on to him?
Damn.
You can see Marengo.
But yeah, I think what's interesting about Steve Jobs
is that like, you can look at the guy from the outside
and be like, wow, like, he actually had insane,
relentless focus on one very small thing,
which was making the iPhone.
One very obvious thing, which was making the iPhone.
But I think you, again, you don't see all the time
that you spend exploring, right?
We can even go down to the keyboard.
There's a book written about the people
that made the iPhone keyboard.
You can buy it.
The amount of years they spent just fucking around
with the iPhone keyboard and exploring different ideas
for years before the iPhone came out.
It was like 2003 when they started working
on the keyboard for the iPhone.
That's like four years.
So again, you all see the final end-focused product, right?
But we don't see all that time spent playing almost.
So I think exploring is often seen as a bad thing,
actually, I think generally,
at least I thought it was a bad thing,
kind of like when I was coming into all this.
It felt like if you were exploring,
you didn't know what you actually were doing.
You were just kind of like fucking around.
And I think that,
I've learned now that,
yeah, it's not just something you do
when you're actually confused.
It should be something that's built into
how you're exploring your ideas
and working on your stuff.
If you're not exploring, then at one point or another,
you're gonna stop understanding where it goes next.
And I think that that's what's hard, right?
You have to kind of be relentless, but then you also be like, huh,
like I should explore some other stuff too.
But then how do you balance that?
I think that's some stuff I wanna talk about.
And yeah, this is like one of the main things I learned.
And if anything you take away from your 40 minutes with me here, it's this.
It's that exploring and focusing aren't mutually exclusive.
For the longest time, I honestly thought they were.
I felt like if you weren't focused as hell all the time,
then you didn't know what you were doing.
But then again, over time, you see that the people,
again, these narratives that are in the world today,
from Steve Jobs to Kobe to Chris Nolan,
all these narratives, they're just narratives.
What actually happened, reality is always different.
But yeah, this is kind of something I learned.
So for me, there's two types of focus.
So I'm going to talk about two types of focus throughout the talk
and just kind of remember the types, right?
So type number one.
Type number one focus, I think, is the most clear one
that most of us know about, which is like you are focused as hell
on a very clear numerical or a very clear milestone.
Like you're just locked in, you're going for it.
Maybe that milestone is directing the movie.
Maybe it's winning that game.
Maybe it's growing a graph.
Maybe it's shipping version one of what you're working on.
It really doesn't matter.
It's just like you're locked in to that one clear thing
and you know that that thing is important as hell
and you're just going for it, right?
Then there's type two focus.
It's kind of more of a focus on playing, honestly,
more of a focus on training, kind of testing your limits.
I think that a lot of times we don't think about this
as focus, but this is essentially focus on exploring,
focus on kind of playing, which I'll talk about too.
So again, those are two types of focus.
Type one, you should just remember,
is kind of the hyper-clear one,
and then type two is more like,
you're just kind of messing about in a very focused way.
So again, this type two could look stuff like this, right?
Like for Kobe, it could be practicing his layups.
It could be improving your writing skills.
It could be trying out a new camera,
playing with a new AI library,
like these sorts of things that keep your mind fresh,
that keep you always thinking about new things
that you could do when you're actually playing the game.
So when you actually need to show up,
you have all of that stuff kind of ready to go,
such that when you just show up,
you're not thinking about messing around,
you're just showing up, you know?
So many people over-index on, I think, one of these.
They either, A, index way too hard on number one,
and then they go super hard on a goal, right?
I think you all could probably think a lot about
people that just go super hard on a goal,
and by the end, they don't even know
why they're going hard on it,
they don't even know if they care about that goal anymore,
and they just question themselves now.
Like, see it all the time in the world of startups
where it's like a founder spends weeks
trying to get like $1,000 in monthly revenue,
but then grinds on that for months and months
and doesn't get anywhere,
and then questions if that's even important,
and then goes down like a bad spiral, right?
You essentially get burned out
just trying to pursue the goal.
But then you don't ask yourself
if that goal is even important anymore.
So again, that can happen.
Again, when you do like a type one focus,
you have to be bought in as hell on that goal.
Like you have to fully believe in it
and fully believe and be patient with it.
And then there's type two focus, right?
That's like where it's like you're more messing around.
I see this all the time too, where people are like,
huh, you know, I just gotta spend time playing around,
messing around, exploring, right?
And then they just go way too hard on that
and then they've explored like 10, 20 things,
but then end up kind of confused again by the end, you know?
And this also is kind of exhausting.
Like imagine how exhausting it is to like,
you know, make a new product every week.
Or like, mess around with a new program every week.
That sounds really hard.
So it's like even making that your focus
is like maybe not the best idea,
even if you are confused.
So again, both are really exhausting actually.
So for me, I have to balance these two.
For me these are the two types of focus,
like me personally.
And I know like where I'm at with both.
And if I don't balance them,
I know I'll get burned out,
and I know I'll get confused,
And then the team will catch on to it very quickly,
and they'll be like, yo, what the fuck are we doing?
And I'm like, yeah, you're right, actually.
What are we doing?
So I gotta balance that, right?
So I wanna give you an example from my own life.
Any questions before I go on?
Cool, yes.
So, maybe this would be better to answer later,
but what about the kind of case
where you see the opportunity,
you know that the only way to capture it is by the other part,
and then you haven't explored enough
to feel prepared to capture it.
What do you prioritize with that?
Where it's like you see what you gotta do,
but then you gotta also explore, essentially?
When you haven't explored or not,
Mm.
Yeah, that's interesting.
Maybe I can kinda go through more,
and if it's not answered, you let me know, okay?
Cool, yeah.
and maybe what looks like you're in a separate place.
How much do you focus on that?
Oh, like how much do I explore and how much do I focus?
Probably answer more later too,
but I think that it varies every two weeks.
So every two weeks, I actually actively change it
with the team and then we very clearly know
how much we're playing, how much we're actually focusing
on a clear output, but I'll cover that as well.
I'll give you an example from my life.
So nights and weekends was my whole life in 2023.
A year of my life was spent on this thing called nights and weekends.
And a year of the life of the team as well, right?
And I think for a lot of the team and for myself, we could argue that,
like when we ended 2023, we all kind of sat together and we're like, wow,
like we all felt that that was the most focused we've ever been in our working
career, which is saying a lot,
because a lot of these guys have spent 20 years working on stuff.
So to say that, even for me,
they felt for me like the most focused I've ever been in my working career.
And reflecting on that was kind of interesting.
And it's like, why?
Can anybody maybe guess why?
Like, I don't even, what do you think?
Why do you think that that ended up being the most focused that I and the team ever ended up being?
Yeah, Kareem.
A lot of people were aligned on the same goal.
A lot of people were aligned on the same goal, like the team?
Yeah.
Yeah, like the team, like, exactly, yeah, sure.
We all kind of saw what was clearly ahead of us, yeah?
The goal was clear and you kept on making progress, so you didn't have to rethink it.
The goal was clear, we didn't have to rethink it.
That's pretty good.
Yeah.
And there's just a ton of people counting on you?
A ton of people counting on you, yeah.
That's very important.
Anything else?
Yes?
So by S4, you knew exactly what to do,
because you've done it.
Yeah, that's huge.
So by S4, we knew exactly what to do,
because it was our fourth time doing it, right?
Yeah.
Seasons are pretty intense.
You guys didn't really have any day
where you could just take a day off.
Yeah, seasons are very intense.
So during nights and weekends, we rarely took a day off.
Those are straight six weeks where we worked.
game time, like the seasons were like six.
Seasons were like game time, yes.
Maybe one more, yeah, I'm here.
I've heard of the smart team mnemonic
where it's like specific, measurable, actionable,
and time-specific, time bound.
And whenever those things are there,
it's very easy to focus on,
I think that's somewhat true for it.
Yeah, yeah, I know, love it, cool, yeah.
I mean, this is all stuff, by the way,
which I didn't even think about
until like maybe three months ago,
where I actually got some time to kind of step back
and be like, wow, like, what was that?
That was kind of crazy guys, like what happened there?
Because now we're working on our next thing,
we're asking ourselves how can we get that focus back,
or even have more focus than we had last year,
because I think we can get there.
But then again, you have to reflect on past times
you were actually focused.
So yeah, during the season each day was clear, right?
We knew exactly what we had to do ahead of time,
because we had talked about it ahead of time.
And also this is, forgetting even this is our fourth time
running it, like it had to have been planned ahead of time.
So like, we didn't just show,
while we did show up every day and,
so generally we did show up every day and ask ourselves,
like, okay, like, what should we do today?
But it was never like that much stuff to choose from.
It was always like very clear.
It's like, oh, should we send that email?
Should we send a message to the audience
reminding them about something?
Maybe it's time to do a live stream,
make that tweet, create a highlight video.
Oh yeah, we have, in real life,
have we locked down the venue?
You know, there's actually not that many actions
to choose from.
you have 350 actions, which is pretty low,
and then you just go for those actions.
So yeah, no issue prioritizing.
There was never a question of what was high-pry,
because it was so obvious.
Like, if Jeffrey was out there exploring,
like, making YouTube videos during nights and weekends,
I'm like, what are you doing?
Like, we have a very clear goal,
and that goal is to get people through nights and weekends.
That's it.
So why are we making YouTube videos?
How does that help?
And yeah, generally, it was crazy that we,
You know, we hear about this thing called the flow state
sometimes, where it's like you reach a flow state yourself
like while you're working, but what if like the thing
that you worked on reached a flow state?
Now I know you guys are single person companies, right?
You all are like your own thing, but in this case
we're six people and these six people reached a flow state
together, right, on what they were working on.
So like how does the work reach a flow state,
not just like you as a person?
I think that's worth thinking about.
And so yeah, we reached that flow state because again,
Well, one, yeah, like Daniel said,
we had momentum, you can't let 18,000 people down.
You know, that's just a great motivator.
Definitely don't want to embarrass yourself
and that plays a part.
But more than that, it was just like,
you don't want to let these people down, right?
They trusted you.
But honestly, I don't think even reflecting back on it
that the numbers mattered.
Season one was 400 people.
Again, the numbers mattered,
but I think not too much to us.
I think the main thing was that we made this very clear plan and just stuck to it.
We knew it was six weeks, we knew what happened at the end, we knew what the
live streams were, we knew we wanted to make videos, we knew we had to like make
a lot of content on socials. Like all these things were known ahead of time
and we agreed on it together. And if something we felt like we agreed on, like
we never agreed on stuff, we felt like you know that's not important. Or rather we
we always made it clear what was not important to us, right? I think that's
That's really important, that's also super important
where it's like, you know, like, just making up an example,
again, like maybe Jeffrey says that we should take the YouTube,
actually, yeah, one thing was obvious,
it's like, we should take the lectures
and then put them on YouTube, right?
Again, this is an idea that was brought up,
and we should translate them to other languages
and put them on YouTube, right?
They could be very helpful.
But again, we were like, well,
I don't know if that helps necessarily.
Like, will that bring, what does that help, right?
Will that get more people through nights and weekends?
Maybe, but we already have recordings.
YouTube already records, so just send in the link.
Why are we out here spending so much time
polishing the videos, making thumbnails now?
What's the point?
So little things like that we agreed on beforehand
and what we felt like was not important.
And I think the other thing reflecting back
is never during the nights and weekends
did we ever question what we were working on.
We never questioned what we were doing, actually.
There was nothing like, damn, should we be doing this?
Or huh, is this the right thing for us to be doing?
We actually never asked that.
Just for six weeks straight, mad focused and just ran.
We didn't think about it at all.
And yeah, because of that,
prioritization happened automatically.
And what I mean by this is like,
by the day, when you come in on a given day,
maybe it's a Wednesday,
you can clearly see what needs to be done
and then you just go do those things.
Like there was no,
prioritization happens when you have too much to do
and you don't know what to choose from.
In this case, there was kind of a very clear set of things
to do and you just did them.
So kind of automatically.
And yeah, I think kind of like Braden said,
this kind of felt like we were in the season
as like a basketball player almost.
And that's kind of structured on purpose like that.
We always felt like nights and weekends
was like our on season.
That's like where we show our best for six weeks straight.
You know?
And that's literally why we structured it like that.
Even as a team, that's what we call it, the on season.
And what's important about the on season for us
is those six weeks.
We were doing the things that we were good at.
We were not doing things that we were not good at.
We were not exploring much.
Like, I'm not sitting there trying to like figure out
how to make TikToks right now during nights weekends
because it's like, am I good at making TikToks?
Are any of you good at making TikToks right now?
No?
Great, we'll talk about that later.
It's not important right now.
So again, we knew what we were good at
and we just had that as the time to focus
on what we were good at, all right?
Does that make sense?
And again, because again, what ends up happening is like,
if you don't do stuff that you're good at,
then you won't show your best work
during that really focused period.
That's like the on-season, right?
And also we had a clear goal.
We wanted a thousand new ideas created during nights and weekends.
That's what we set months before we even started.
And we knew that if we did this,
a lot of good shit would be done along the way.
Like we'd make great videos, we'd make great content.
Because for this to happen, a lot has to go right.
So we knew that if we hit that number, we'd be good.
So again, we agreed that that goal was very important to us
and we would stick to it and we wouldn't question it.
And we never did, actually.
And then yeah, you have your on seasons, right?
but then we had our off-seasons.
So, uh, nights and weekends is, uh, six weeks, right?
But then we had our off-seasons.
This is kinda what it sounds like.
This is just time where we just reflect,
play around, and test our limits again.
It's almost like training. Um, really.
Uh, it's just time- it's just a time where we, uh,
don't have like a pressure to deliver per se on something particular,
where we don't have to show our best necessarily in that moment.
Um, we just had to like, uh,
show up and explore something new, that's it.
So again, we kind of built in,
well at least we built into the company
and how we work time to play,
which I think is something you all should think about.
As you hear this, I know you don't have a six person team,
but you need to think of yourself as a company,
no matter what you're doing.
And I would ask yourself,
does your company give you time to play?
You know, like, Mattia, you know, you work at a company.
It's your own company.
Does your company give you time to play?
Does your company make you show up like a madman every day?
You know, like I would ask yourself,
if this is even the thing,
if the thing that you're working on
is what you kind of want to be,
is like treating you properly, but,
I don't know, any thoughts there on that?
Yeah, plays more if I keep myself to play,
and sometimes I feel like I don't,
I feel like I do more.
Yeah, it's actually really cool
to separate yourself sometimes,
as like the company and then you.
Like you're, no matter what you're doing, right,
like you're a single guy working on a single project,
You know, and the company, what's the company called right now?
Superdash.
Still Superdash? I love it.
So Superdash.
Does Superdash give Matija time to play?
Does Superdash give Matija time to like,
or does Superdash ask him to come in every day,
nine to nine, and grind like a madman,
even if he doesn't know what he's doing?
I would ask yourself, like each of you, that question.
Like, is it fun to work at your company?
Even if you're the only employee there, you know?
And yeah, this is a thought that I had many years ago
at BuildSpace, so I was like, my job is just to make
the company a really great place to work.
And I think if I do that, I'll also do really good work.
So yeah, that's why we have off-season, we train, right?
That's because I really, and this is my opinion, right?
I think it's unrealistic to be on all the time.
You know, on being like, you're giving your best effort
every day, grinding nine to nine, 12 hour,
12 months a year, right?
Kinda like the classic hustle culture stuff you see online
or even like most narratives that you see, right?
Christopher Nolan grinds like hell during his set.
I gotta grind like hell.
Well, again, I just think it's unrealistic
to be that on all the time.
Because my feeling is that you have emotions
and you have limits that you don't even know yet
and you'll probably break down.
And you'll probably just lose to yourself.
So again, maybe you are able to be on all the time,
but I just don't think it's realistic.
So you should probably assume that you can't be on
all the time.
Which is kind of funny in the sense that
most people don't think about it like this,
they kind of assume that they have to be on all the time.
Like there's not an option where you're not on all the time.
But again, it's kind of crazy to expect Kobe to be playing
like it's the fourth quarter every single day,
even during practice, so yeah.
I feel like a company can be on all the time
where there are like a bunch of people
where a person as an individual has their off time
and their on time, but the company as a whole
is constantly putting out stuff.
But if you're just a solo person,
you cannot be on all the time.
I think even as a company, you can't be on all the time.
It's pretty hard, honestly.
But yeah, I mean, we're a company.
I can't expect everyone to be on all the time.
They'll burn out, you know?
And even you, you're Samia Records.
Samia Records has one artist signed, it's Samia, right?
Which is you.
And I think that in that case, yeah,
Samia Records needs to give Samia time to chill.
Samia Records needs to give Samia time
where they're pressuring him to really get stuff done,
you know?
So I think it's just a way to think about it.
Kind of detach yourself from the thing
you're working on in a little way.
But yeah, no, honestly, even as a company,
I have never seen it work like that.
Where there's always times, even at a real company,
it's like they have on-seasons, they have off-seasons,
You know, like you release the iPhone, then you chill.
Then you make the iPhone 2, you know?
Like you have like these iterations.
Cool.
And yeah, why did we do the off season?
It was a perfect time for us just to question
what we want to do next.
During on season, like when you're just playing,
you're not even questioning anything.
You're just like, let's go.
Like I'm running.
I'm not even like asking myself where we're running.
I'm not even questioning where the car is going.
I'm just going.
But in this case, you need to have time where you're like,
Yo, do I, what's going on actually?
Do we still agree with where we're going?
Do we feel like it's the right thing to do?
If so, let's keep going, right?
So you have to question.
Yeah, this is actually interesting.
Sometimes our off seasons were like very short,
like just two weeks, where we'd be like,
just mess around, take some time off, and then come back.
But sometimes you're a lot longer, right?
Two weeks was the best case scenario.
This off season we're in right now is more like six months,
like right now, like what we're doing.
This is very purposely done by me,
just because I felt like,
you know, I just felt like,
I didn't by myself feel that there was a type number one goal,
like a clear goal that I was just like excited
to go hard on for the next 12 months.
And I was like, I don't think I have to like pretend
that I do, it's pretty exhausting.
Instead, great, like let's just spend time
playing around for six months even,
like what's the problem?
And that's what we're doing now, right?
But I think what I found is that,
yeah, you just need more time to play around,
But I think that what's very important here is that this doesn't mean we're just spending
every day messing around on something brand new, you know, or just exploring mindlessly.
I think that would be a mistake.
That would be terrible.
That's just like us wasting our time and just exploring our curiosity every day in a really
kind of unfocused way.
Like for example, like, I'll go back to this example actually.
I think that even if we're still exploring right now,
there's still very clear goals, right?
So every two weeks, as BuildSpace, we set new goals.
Very clear type one goals that we are aligned on.
For example, this is our current two weeks goal.
We set goals every two weeks, right?
So within this two week period,
we want to hit 500k accounts on IG, 50k views on YouTube,
and we want to get this web demo of our product shipped.
That's it.
These are still pretty light goals actually,
but they're still kind of concise and clear,
They're like type one goals.
But again, this isn't what I wake up in the morning
to go after, right?
They're more just guiding my play time.
That way I'm not doing a bunch of random nonsense
all the time, I'm still kind of focused.
I'm like, okay, we're still making content on IG.
We're not fucking running on TikTok per se,
because that's a whole different game.
So again, it's kind of like how do you play
in a focused way?
And again, the numbers can help you.
So again, this is us, this is literally our numbers,
these are literally our goals.
the only three goals we have as a company
for the next, well now, four more days.
So we gotta hit that, otherwise we didn't make it.
And yep, these update every two weeks.
Very simple for us.
And I think this is a really great way
for you guys to think about your stuff too.
I think two weeks is,
two weeks to me is like the perfect amount of time
to try something, see how it went,
and then think about what to do next.
So every two weeks you kind of question
the things that you are doing.
That's at least what we do and it works for me.
Cool, and yeah, this is six weeks in
to this off season technically,
or actually more like 10 weeks in.
But every day is really cool.
We're getting a little more focused
and we're playing around a little bit less every day.
We're getting closer and closer to that feeling of like,
I'm ready to go into the season, you know?
Like put me in coach.
But again, we're not quite there yet.
We can feel it in ourselves too.
But we know once we are ready to spend just six months
degenning whatever goal we're trying to degen on,
we're gonna go for that.
But right now, I'm not gonna do it.
That would just exhaust me
and I'd probably quit in six months.
So let's not do that.
Yeah, any questions up to that point?
And then it's my last point here.
Yes?
What do you guys do if you don't get your
every two week goals?
What does that conversation mean?
We just ask ourselves what happened?
Was it a lack of effort?
Did something else come in the way?
Or was it a bad goal?
Or were we just lazy?
What was it?
And often it's different reasons,
but we just question it.
But usually it comes down to other stuff
got in the way that kind of blocked our focus.
So, yeah.
What was the goal two weeks before this?
Two weeks before this was just
to start getting stuff out on YouTube and IG,
just put stuff on YouTube and IG, that's it.
Just put stuff.
and start to actually get like the tech demo of the product going,
like the little green CLI thing that I made. That's it.
A follow up is, would you recommend us to also try to tweak our goal every two weeks,
or is that more of like a competent thing?
No, I think every two weeks,
I don't know if it's tweak your goal more than is like tweak how you're gonna do the next two weeks.
That's how we think about it.
So it's like every two weeks we think about where we're going,
just as on what we're working on and then,
how we think about it is like for example,
we do the meetings on Sundays, right?
So we meet up every Sunday or every other Sunday and we ask ourselves,
what are we doing for the next 14 days?
That's it. So that's kind of all the plan that you need.
That's all the plan that we need to be honest.
So I think that's probably good enough for you guys too.
So yeah.
Yeah, we actually don't have like this super long-term goal right now per se,
but that's fine to be honest.
Like it's okay, you figure that out over time.
Also, it's worth thinking,
this is actually something I learned very harshly
in like last year, throughout last year.
There's patience and faith in a plan.
Something that actually,
you know, I can describe as many things,
but I don't think patient is one of them in 2022 per se.
By 2023, I feel like, dude, I got really patient.
Like just by accident, I got really good at being patient.
Almost by design, nights and weekends is six weeks, right?
But before that, you spend four to six weeks marketing it,
and then after that, you spend two weeks running IRL,
spending hundreds of thousands of dollars
making those events happen,
having people fly across the world.
So in reality, we're really stuck with this thing
called nights and weekends for like a minimum three months.
So what's cool about that is actually,
like you can't change, you're not allowed to change.
You have to actually sit in the box
and then just get good at being in the box.
you can't stop the car and turn it around.
It's impossible.
Like, there's a very clear plan,
and if you, yeah, like, what does stopping the car
and turning around look like in nights and weekends?
Like, stopping it, like shutting it down,
like canceling the in real life programs,
like all of a sudden, like,
people will waste their money and time.
All of a sudden, like, XYZ things will happen, right,
that are negative.
But again, we actually did this on purpose
because I felt like as a team, we had to kind of lock in,
And so we made this system to help us lock in actually.
And then yeah, the only goal for those three months
is let's go as far as we can.
But let's not be questioning where the GPS is taking us.
Let's know where we're going,
but let's not be being like,
oh, can we go to McDonald's at that exit?
Or like, oh, can we stop there?
Like no, we're just going.
And you can imagine this is what ends up happening, right?
you end up having these beautiful kind of like sprints of focus because all of a sudden you're not questioning the plan.
It's almost like you're assembling an IKEA desk.
Like you don't question the plan when you're assembling an IKEA desk, you know.
You just, you make the IKEA desk in two hours and you're done.
So why can't you do that with your work?
Well it's probably just something that you have to figure out yourself actually.
But yeah.
Now, um, so I do want to be honest here.
When I say stick to the plan, things can change, okay?
But at its core, like the thing stays the same.
So for example, one very change, one change we made maybe two days before the season started,
season four was, we originally had guest speakers kind of, we wanted,
but then like two days before I was like, nah, cut it, just cut it.
So again, things like that can change, but I'm not like, should we cancel the season?
you know should we like uh do other things like no like the core plan still stays the same
or on what it is you know uh so yeah uh but yeah no you know i think a lot of you guys uh know what
crisis mode is you kind of get you can get in it very quickly uh but during those times uh you know
we definitely never had a crisis there was no time to have a crisis uh and yeah uh it's beautiful
And you can set that up for yourself too.
What is your on-season?
What is your off-season?
How do you think about that?
So maybe during Build Space here, this is your on-season.
Maybe not treating it like that right now, but maybe it is.
I think it's worth asking yourself.
What point of the journey you're on?
What type of focus you need?
And yeah, I learned this last year, to be honest.
Even building this place, which took three months to lock down the space
and then three months to construct it and then design it and blah, blah, blah.
like that takes a lot of just faith in the plan and a lot of money goes into it and it's like you
just have to kind of trust that it'll work but you have to stick to a plan you know otherwise if you
don't stick to the plan you waste a lot of time energy human resources etc so and yeah i always
make um oh so this is what to say i make time to reevaluate uh yeah don't ever be like mindlessly
going down a path all the time and become an MPC.
I think that's not it either.
Yeah, this is, I don't know if I should,
this is worth mentioning.
Sometimes the difference between patience in a plan
and versus just waiting.
You know, I think there's a difference.
For example, like maybe you're putting an effort right now
when something's working or something's not working.
Um, like should you continue being patient if it's not working?
What's the difference between being patient and just waiting, right?
Um, can anybody like maybe give me a thought there?
What they think is the difference?
Yeah?
Patience is like you're still doing something else,
like you're still working on something else while either way you don't
do anything you just kind of still-
Yeah, patience is like- Patience is like the,
where you did something, you just need to wait for the result.
Waiting is like, you're literally just waiting around
for something to hit you.
And I think a lot of people end up in that scenario
where they're just waiting for magic
to magically happen to them.
But it's not gonna happen, right?
So it's like, patience is a little bit different.
Patience is like, you did something
and now you just gotta await the result.
Which can take time, it can take months even.
It can take weeks, it can take days.
It depends on what you're doing, right?
So, just worth mentioning here,
because again, something I struggled with for a while.
And then yeah, these are questions that kind of ate at me
for a long time.
Am I on the right track?
Am I wasting time?
I ask myself these questions to this day.
Is this the right thing to focus on?
Should I change the plan?
You know, all types of stuff.
And you know, asking these questions is definitely not bad.
It's just, it's actually good to be honest
because it's a sign that something is up,
but it's up to you to figure out what is going on.
So yeah, just don't let these questions destroy you,
like internally, because I think they definitely can,
and you can just let them eat at you and it's horrible.
It's just, take that as a moment to be like,
damn, like what is going on?
Like am I focused?
Am I doing the right things?
What could change?
Who do I need to talk to?
All these things, right?
And yeah, that's about it.
Cool, any questions?
Thank you, Brandon.
Yes?
I don't think you answered the question that I asked in the middle.
Oh nice, what was the question? I forgot.
It was the hypothetical scenario where you see an opportunity that opportunity demands game time focus.
And you haven't done enough exploring around it to actually...
Oh sure, that's actually the scenario I'm in right now.
Like, I see a consumer product that billions of people can be using, like, in the next decade.
Like, literally, I see it in my brain right now.
Like, I see the opportunity, hyper-clear, I build space.
But I know that right now, both me and the team and the company are in not a position to chase it, like, relentlessly right now.
So it's asking yourself, like, do you need relentless focus right now?
Or do you just need more time kind of training up a little bit to get to the point where you can be relentless for, like, even a year?
So my kind of thing right now is like get company get even myself to the point where I can be relentless for like 12 months straight
Because that's like a minimum that's kind of needed for at least what I'm going after right which is building like a consumer product
But it's worth asking but again, it's like exactly kind of what I'm going through right now
I'll bang it. I don't actually know the right answer if you ask Furkan
He may give you a very different answer Furkan if I were to ask him this may just say
Like what the fuck just be relentless just go after right now. What are you doing exploring and shit?
Now again, everyone's gonna have a different answer.
That's the thing.
There's no right and wrong.
But I just know one thing that if I'm relentless right now,
dude, I'm gonna have an emotional breakdown in six months
and then this is shutting down.
I already know myself.
So what's the point?
I'd rather take it my way.
But yeah, it's kinda hard
because you see a beautiful opportunity
and you're like, oh my God, I hope no one does this.
I hope no one does it better,
but it's like, oh, these are just the wrong thoughts.
I'm gonna be the best to do it
And if not, that was faith.
So I just kind of trust a little bit about it.
Yes?
Does game time for a company require
being together in person?
For a company?
It just depends, man.
For me, yeah.
For me personally, yeah.
Yeah.
I don't know if you guys have a lot of remote stuff going
on in your life, or you have remote people helping you.
I don't know.
But generally, I'm not into remote.
But that's why we're all here, actually.
Yeah.
Yo, what up?
How do you understand when it's time to explore or focus?
Because I mean, for meds and weekends, it's like pretty straightforward, I would say,
because it's like six weeks program, you can roll all in, and then maybe sometimes put an ex.
But for a lot of other types of companies, it's more like, there is no really defined time-lice, I mean, you guess.
So...
You just got to know yourself.
Like even right now, now we're building a product, right?
So I'm giving us six, I just told myself six months.
It's gonna take six months for us to build the right team,
to even get myself, for even myself to get really good at AI,
and all these things.
It's gonna take six months to get the right pieces together
for us to go hard, you know?
So that's kind of how I see it.
But again, it's kind of up to you.
Maybe you see that probably,
that's gonna take me a month, you know?
I need just a month to mess around.
It really does depend.
So for me, how I think about it is like,
you wanna have like,
like you know how like a UFC fighter looks next,
like looks really forward to their next fight,
and like their next fight could be like six months away,
but they'll train like hell for six months
to fight one guy usually, right?
They'll just train for one guy.
That's really cool because now they know
what they're being relentless for, you know,
for that one fight.
So again, for us, I don't really know
what my next fight is clearly.
So like, why would I just start training like mad?
You know?
So for me, my general kind of feeling is like,
okay, as far as them, I need six months to play around
with the team, I need six months to put together
even the right team.
And then if I put in those six months,
I think by summer, I can be relentless for 12 months.
So step for 2023 to 2020, from 2024 summer to 2025 summer,
I, my head is like going, you know?
That's kind of how I think about it.
But it's different for all of you.
So.
Yeah, this is more for like, okay,
when I understand when to focus,
whatever the other way around, like,
I'm focusing, how do you understand the need
and the need to explore?
It's like maybe when I reach that goal
that I set for myself or it's like more like a feeling,
okay, I've given anything, everything to this,
maybe I should just do that.
Yeah, so what's the question you think?
If you want to summarize it for me?
How do you understand when it's time to start?
Yeah, that's actually a good question.
How do you understand when it's time
to just like lock in, like essentially.
Then stop focusing and go explore.
Oh, to stop focusing and go explore.
Sure, sure, sure.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no I understand, I understand.
I think for me it's like when the goal doesn't excite me.
For example, like a million downloads
doesn't really excite me,
a million users doesn't really excite me.
Like, so I gotta find some time to figure out
what does excite me, like what goal does excite me.
It's like, oh shit, building like a breakthrough
consumer product that does X, Y, Z, that excites me.
But you learn about it over time, you know?
Because I'm not really driven by numbers, to be honest.
A billion is cool though, that's pretty cool.
But like a million won't really get to me, you know?
So it's like, you have to just know yourself, you know?
Everyone's so different.
Maybe it's some amount of people in your fan base,
maybe it's like, just for me personally,
it's like I'll stop exploring once I feel like,
yo, I'm really good at my craft.
Like I'm good enough to actually be the best
in the world at this now, or be one of the best,
if I'm just like relentless now for 12 months.
So again with the kind of AI stuff,
I'm taking like my own little like dip into it
where I'm like I think I can myself
be one of the best in the world,
but then also have people around me that are,
like you know, the team has to make an adjustment now.
Like they have to get locked in, et cetera,
into this world, so it takes six months to happen.
Yeah, yeah, cool.
But it's really just a feeling, dude, but yeah, yeah.
So when you spend five like in off-season
and training and stuff like that,
You still have goals, right?
Yeah.
And so how do you, like how do those goals differ from when you're on season goals?
Is it that the on season goal is just one goal for a really long time?
Yeah, exactly.
For, so for me, like when it's like, uh, like the on season goal is like the one that you're
like relentless for and it doesn't change.
Like it's just, this is, we're, we're locked in, we're not going to move, right?
Like we are releasing Oppenheimer, like six months, we're locked in for six months to
release Oppenheimer, right?
Whereas these off-season goals,
they change every two weeks actually.
So right now we're focused up on IG and YouTube
and building this demo product, right?
But then two weeks from now it may change.
And that's okay, because they're kind of meant to change.
And meant to discover what the right goals are.
So again, that's why we do it.
But again, with all of this,
just know this is how I operate, this is how we operate.
This is not normal per se, but this is what works for us.
So yeah, cool.
All right, everyone.
Maybe last question.
Adam?
Yeah, I can really relate to the IRL
and almost this set date where there's accountability.
Yeah, yeah.
It's like three months.
You know, like working events and stuff,
it's like really similar.
And I'm kind of reflecting that's when the most productivity
flow happens.
Yeah.
And shifting to content, shifting away
from those hard public kind of accountability moments,
I guess.
Like I'm trying to figure out what does,
how can I create that in another way for myself when it's not a, you know.
When it's not like a hard deadline.
Yeah.
You know, that's tough.
Actually like I only work on hard deadlines.
Like I'm actually like, I think I mentioned for like classically kind of lazy.
But if you give me a deadline and I know I have to show up by the deadline,
like I'll show up, you know.
So it's like even today like we work on deadlines.
Like there's a deadline on Friday for us to get the demo out.
Like there's a fire underneath me like if I don't do it.
Now will anyone get mad?
No, actually only I'll be like, what the fuck, you know?
Maybe the team will be like, what the fuck, you know?
But you know, that's still a deadline.
But it's not like thousands of people depending on us
or a giant thing that's about to happen.
It's just us, it's just me almost.
So I think the deadlines are pretty cool.
But again, you kind of know yourself best
because yeah, build space without deadlines.
Like I know what happens, like we just do a lot of stuff
and mess around but nothing actually gets out.
So stuff needs to still get out.
Yeah, sure.
I have this strategy that worked for 50% of the people.
It's that I commit to the idea publicly
that I'm creating my second album
and it will be out by next year.
You know, that gives me, for some people, like it works, for some people, it's like they can still push the deadline, but I'm the kind of person if I come into the public to something, it's more like an ego thing.
For sure. No, so even for me, like, for example, why did we do this stream on 2 slash 4? Right?
There's actually really no reason other than Stavan thought that 2 slash 4 slash 24 looked cool, like as a date.
Like that was it.
But that happened to be two weeks from now.
And so we just kind of like told ourselves,
okay, the moment I press this button,
everybody's gonna know that we're doing something in 2.4.
And if we don't, we're gonna publicly embarrass ourselves.
And the whole team knew that like, okay,
like let's not embarrass ourselves.
So yeah, dude, something about like,
making, staying accountable for the world,
like within the world's eyes is interesting.
I'm not sure if it's healthy to be honest, but it works.
Yeah, we just created art, it's all right.
From Dean.
And with that, thank you everyone.
