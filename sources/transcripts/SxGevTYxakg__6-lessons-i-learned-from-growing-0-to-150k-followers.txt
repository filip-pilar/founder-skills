This is six lessons learned from creating content.
So hi, my name is Mylene.
Some of you may know that I make videos about lessons in my 20s.
So these are some of the videos that I make on Instagram.
And it basically are, they're just cinematic reels that capture things that I've learned
throughout my 20 years of living.
Today, though, I want to do something a little bit different.
And I wanted to share the lessons from my journey of actually creating.
So kind of more behind the scenes, what it's been like as a content creator over the past
year and how my perspectives have sort of changed throughout this journey. So one year ago I was
here literally in this room. So my content journey started off in SF1 here at Buildspace,
but it also started off here. I had zero subscribers, I hadn't started my YouTube
channel yet, I didn't have Instagram yet, and I barely had picked up a camera even. So that's
kind of where it started. Now I'm here literally physically in the space again, but also now with
more eyes on my content but this doesn't actually matter the numbers don't really mean that much at
the end of the day what really matters and what i really want to focus on in this talk is how my
relationship with creating content has changed over the past year because i think when you're
going through the cycle of creating content it's really hard to kind of zoom out and see the full
picture and so now that it's been almost a full year of me creating content i think it's really
interesting to just analyze how my perspective on creating has changed over time and what that kind
of looks like so if i were to depict it on a graph this is kind of what it would look like
so this is basically my relationship with creating content over time and kind of how i felt as you
can see it's really not linear at all so i'm gonna the basis of this presentation is basically going
to be me digging into different segments of time and the things that i learned during those phases
of time so starting off with the very beginning so this was basically me when i was first getting
started in build space sf1 when i was just getting started and creating content at the time i was
making youtube videos exclusively i wasn't really even focusing on instagram or anything like that
and i was posting one youtube video per week the goal at the time was to hit 5 000 subscribers
but this goal was actually hurting me and i didn't realize it at the time
So this is kind of the graph of what my metrics looks like through that span of
creating during build space. I was posting videos every week but again there isn't
really a big spike of growth what and that's what I was thinking or hoping
would happen. So each week that I kept showing up and each week that I wasn't
blowing up or things the views weren't hitting what I thought they would I
would just feel like even lower and lower so that's why the relationship of
me creating content kind of decreased over time. There would be like the small
winds of when i'd post a video but then it would just go back into a low of wondering why things
hadn't yet blown up and so the first lesson here that i realized was you should really be focusing
more on the inputs rather than the outputs so you can't control who follows you you can't control how
many people view your content but what you can control is how often you show up so the next big
question i feel like that i often hear is okay but how often should i show up so personally for me i
really don't like daily posting I think that that's something that at least for
me is kind of unrealistic and just makes me feel like I don't have enough time
to actually live life and I'm just spending more time editing and you know
making videos but not actually feeling inspired and living life so I think my
advice when it comes to figuring out a good cadence for how often you should be
posting it's really on picking something that is recurring and still pushes you
but isn't something that takes away from just feeling inspired and being able to
to actually live your life and experience things and have stories to tell.
So that ties into the second lesson which is,
at what point do you go from quantity to quality?
So I was talking to another creator,
her name is actually April Lynn,
that's Rock's girlfriend if you remember Rock's,
he was also an SF1 person or student in the school.
I was talking to her a lot about this journey of creating,
and I think a lot of the times it's really hard to tell when you should
sacrifice quality over just posting on a recurring schedule and one of the pieces
of advice that she gave to me and really really stuck with me was when you know
for a fact that you're gonna keep showing up so for example if your dream
is to become a content creator or your dream is to grow big on YouTube and you
know for a fact that that's a goal that you're gonna take to the grave basically
or it's something that you know for a fact you're gonna keep showing up even
on the rainy days then that's when you can kind of start to choose to
to prioritize quality a little bit more.
Even when talking to some of the other YouTubers
in the SF1 cohort at the time,
it was always a balance of,
do I spend two weeks to create
this video or a month even to create this video,
or do I just push something out right away
just to get something out there?
I think when you know for a fact that you're going to keep showing up,
that's when you can keep spending a little bit of extra time.
Because otherwise, you run into a case where
if you're still shaky on your goals,
still not really sure if you have it in you to keep going if you spend four weeks six weeks
whatever on a video it's very possible that you might just fall off right there and not show up
anymore because you felt like you took so long on that video so when you don't know if you'll keep
showing up I think that's when it's really important to choose consistency so moving on to the next
part of my journey at this point in time now I had just finished SF1 and I'm back into the world
trying to figure out what exactly it means to me to continue creating content.
At this point, I felt pretty jaded in terms of metrics, and I decided to just kind of toss those
out the window. So I started focusing less on the number of subscribers, the number of views,
and just finding what actually brings me joy in creating content and what does that actually look
like. So at this point in time, again, I started letting go of the metrics, and I started spending
longer on videos and creating things that I actually like. This is a project that I made,
which is very unrelated to any of
the other content that I had made at the time.
It was a longer project that involved more people,
and so it took longer to release,
but it just really reinvigorated that joy of creating again.
So, at that point in time,
I also even opened up to experimenting to short form content.
I was actually extremely closed off to
short form content at the time because I thought
that short form content would restrict me
from being able to express my ideas creatively.
But what I actually realized was this new form of content
that I was restricting myself from was actually
allowing me to experiment with my ideas faster and more often.
So, I actually did really enjoy
the fact that I started creating more short form content.
So, at the beginning of my journey,
I was creating a lot of pretty random stuff.
I wasn't really putting a whole lot of effort into short form content.
I was just choosing to post once or twice a week,
and not really much was happening here.
It was just me getting the reps in
and trying to understand this new platform.
So, I think the most important lesson that came in
in this point of time and one that you'll probably hear me say a lot,
especially if you talk to me afterwards or
even just in a lot of stuff that I do right now,
it's learning how to have fun again.
I think this has been one of the most pivotal learnings for me and
the biggest perspective shifts that I've had in creating content.
Because fun is really what takes an idea from
a thought to a finished video most consistently.
Fun is what keeps you trying new things even when you feel like things are tough or you want to give up.
Fun is the thing that keeps you long enough to see you win.
Because people usually quit before they even have a chance to see the benefits or their hard work pay off.
So as long as you focus on keeping things fun and enjoying the process,
then that's probably one of the most surefire ways of guaranteeing that you'll stick around and be alive long enough to see that hard work pay off.
So, I think one of the biggest questions that you might have is,
but how will making stuff for fun actually help me?
Is making something silly or random actually going to turn into something one day?
I think a lot of people think too much when they're creating
content about what other people want to see,
but they're missing a really fundamental thing
about what they actually want to create.
So, this leads to this thing that I call the cycle of frustration.
So, you've probably run into this cycle before
if you've tried creating content on your own,
where you have that initial excitement where you're just like,
oh, I'm so excited to create something.
Then you create that thing,
maybe it flops or it doesn't do as well as you thought it would,
and you try to look at what works and you're researching all these things.
You're looking at retention editing,
the attention economy,
you're looking at all these hacks and all these things that maybe
don't really resonate with you but you try anyways because everyone says they work.
But a fundamental thing is missing from the cycle,
and that is purely just fun. It's understanding what is actually fun for you to create and what
you actually enjoy. And so at this point in time in my Instagram or my content journey,
I was creating stuff that didn't really provide value for anyone, but it was just really fun for
me to make. So at the time I was in Japan for a little bit and I was just making these really
cinematic reels of just beautiful things that I saw. And these didn't get that much views. I know
I know it looks like it has thousands,
but literally this only happened after my other content started blowing up.
So these had maybe a few hundred views at the time, if even.
So eventually, as you start creating more things just for fun,
you start to gain momentum again.
After you start to gain momentum,
that's when you can start to look at the intersection of fun and impact.
So I think, again, going back to what I was saying
earlier about how most people look too much,
how can I add value to others?
I think one way that you can kind of merge or intersect the two is first thinking about what interests you.
So again, what is something that you actually want to create?
What is something that genuinely brings you joy and you feel excited about?
And then from there, you can start to tailor into a lens of how might this apply to others?
So for example, with my lesson series, it was interesting to me because I always do end of year reflections.
I always kind of reflect on the year.
and so whenever I was making one of those videos I would then think about okay
how might this apply to others well they might be thinking about similar things
they might be you know curious to learn about how I've navigated things that
they might experience and that helped me tailor what I was creating in a way
that kind of hit both boxes of both being fun for myself but then also being
applicable or adding value to others so moving on in time of my content journey
At this point in time,
my relationship with creating content,
as you can see, was improving as I was
prioritizing more of what actually drove me,
what was actually fun for me.
At this point in time,
I was trying to navigate a lot of different things.
I was creating the series,
the 23 lessons in 2023 series.
This is when I learned that it's really,
really important to experiment with intention.
I think that when it comes to content creation in particular,
there's a lot of variables that come to mind, right?
There's what platforms to use,
what styles, does gear actually matter?
There's a lot of different things that you can experiment with.
And it's really hard to actually tell what's
working because there's just too many variables at stake.
And so I think one thing that I want to really dig into is how I
experimented with my 23 lessons in 2023 series and kind of what I learned from that.
So I think that creating content is very much so like baking a cake.
You can choose different ingredients and there's a lot of different aspects to it.
There's your theme, there's the script, there's the hook, music, visuals.
There's all these different components that can be combined in so many different ways to produce different results.
And so 23 Lessons from 2023 was my cake, essentially.
And so as you can see here, for my first five videos of this series, I had the same introduction.
So I had this match cut introduction as like one piece of the cake or one ingredient of the cake.
And none of these videos really popped off.
But the one that did happened to be the next one, which is one where...
Okay, so you can kind of see the difference here where it's like for this one,
I started off all five of the videos the same way.
And if you're a viewer who's just scrolling through your feed, it looks like it's all the same video.
because you just see the same match cuts every single time.
I didn't really realize that.
So when I experimented suddenly with introducing the hook first,
like what you saw in the last slide,
that was the video that actually blew up.
Because I had so many other videos of a similar nature,
those other videos are to blow up as well.
So it gave a lot of people something to latch on to and keep
following along rather than just having
one viral video and then people forget about you after.
So I think that this way of experimentation is really important
because there's a consistent theme across the whole series.
So people know what to expect,
but there's a lot of room for you to experiment with your style and how you edit,
the visuals that you use, how you tell your story.
So I think when you think about experimentation,
try to reduce the amount of variables there while still
having some consistent theme that allows you to be flexible in different ways.
So, this brings me to now lesson number five.
So, before things started to blow up with that series,
there was a point in time where again,
I was questioning what am I really doing?
Is this really going to pay off?
I wasn't really sure where things were headed at the time.
So, I remember I was reaching out to
Farza and a few other people just asking for feedback,
asking them what they thought about my content.
This is a message that really stuck with me that Farza said,
and you guys can read it on the screen,
But the TLDR of this message is basically,
how can you look outside of what you're doing right now
and control your own destiny?
Are there other things that you can do outside of just making
content that can increase your odds?
And so for me, this really got me thinking about what I was doing.
Because at this point in time, I felt
like I was making something that resonated with what I liked.
It was fun.
The only missing piece was I was just wondering
why people weren't seeing it.
Because I felt really confident in it.
I got really good feedback from some of my peers and things like that,
but it still wasn't really blowing up.
So what I realized was if the right people aren't coming to you,
you have to go find them.
So I think one of the most important things outside of even just creating content,
is also just finding other people in your community or in the niche that you're interested in.
So I spent a lot of time on Instagram just looking for creators who I resonated with,
creators who inspired me and creators who I thought I could learn from.
From there, I actually found, for example, Adrian Per,
and he had this Discord community at the time,
where he would literally do work reviews,
and he would just review people's work and give them feedback.
But most people, again, they're so busy with creating that they
don't think to go find these things or they don't think to go find these resources.
So this right here, I know there's no sound,
but I remember I went into Adrian's work review.
I submitted the video that I made on YouTube of the dear strangers,
so getting strangers to read letters.
Him and his girlfriend literally cried on stream watching the video.
That was a huge motivation for me.
Even though at the time I didn't have the validation of all these views or followers,
what kept me going was knowing that big creators or people who I looked up to,
like Adrian, were still acknowledging my work.
So if you don't get the attention that you want,
just go find those people,
go see where they're at and try to make them notice you.
I think that was probably one of the biggest things
that I had learned in my journey.
So eventually after continuing to do all these things,
continuing to show up,
continuing to try to find other creators,
my account blew up and people ended up finding my other work,
as I mentioned before,
which just continued on this loop of growth.
So it may sound like everything is going great and
everything is going well.
So why is there another dip?
Well, I think one thing that's really interesting is that you think that going
viral will solve all of your problems and that life will suddenly be different.
But I remember when I blew up,
I was just in my bedroom.
It was like December right before the holidays and I was like sick because I
had just come back from Japan.
And I was just thinking to myself like, wow, nothing, nothing really changed.
I don't really know what I was expecting to happen after I went viral.
But life was very much the same.
So, I think this again just goes back to
the whole message that
imposter syndrome doesn't really go away.
So, if you think that virality
or going big is going to solve your problems,
the truth is it's not.
The most important thing again is just finding
joy in the process which is why I keep going back to
that theme of just learning how to have fun.
So, yeah, going viral won't solve your problems.
Refer back to lesson three which is learn how to have fun again.
So I guess for me,
another big part of having fun in the journey
was not making content my whole life.
So I don't know if a lot of you guys know this,
but I actually ended up signing
onto a full-time job in January of this year.
I think a lot of people assume that when you go viral or when you make it big,
you're just going to go full-time on being a content creator.
But I think for me again,
just as someone who is still trying to figure out what my style is,
and what I really want to do with content creation.
For me, getting a job at the time was
a really good choice for me just because I was able to
now do content as something that was more of a fun outlet,
and not necessarily rely on it as
my main livelihood or source of income.
So I think that's just something to think about,
because I think a lot of people again,
kind of idealize this whole creator lifestyle.
But the thing about that is,
once you start creating and you rely on
sponsorships as your main source of income,
once you stop creating, so does the money.
The money also stops coming in.
So, this is just something that I'm
transparently also trying to navigate right now in
my point in time of content of
how do I actually turn this into a lifestyle?
Is that something that I even actually want?
So, for me at least right now,
having a job is just something that allows me to keep
content fun and allows me to experiment without having to worry about,
for example, my engagement rates or things like that tanking.
So yeah, this is where I am right now.
Still trying to continually improve
my relationship with creating content and learn along the way.
I'm still trying to find my style.
I think that as much as I feel like
I've found something that works for me,
as a creative you're always trying to figure out,
how can you be better?
How can you continue showing up in new creative ways?
So for me, I'm trying to find my style.
I think the thing that I've realized in this process is that
the biggest differentiator is you at the end of the day.
So I think that if you show up authentically,
you show up as you,
then that's the best way to
guarantee that the right people will find you.
I think we often hear the case of people who go viral off of one video,
but it's not actually something that they like creating,
and then they end up stuck in that niche.
So I think if there's one thing to keep in mind,
and this is pretty generic stuff,
but I think it's a good reminder,
is that if you just show up as yourself and
do things that you're uniquely positioned to do,
I think that's the biggest differentiator that you have
against any other creators at the end of the day.
So, show up as you as much as possible,
and create more, consume less, stay creating.
So, that's my talk.
I don't know if anyone has any questions,
but.
.
.
.
Good question.
I'm just kind of thinking out loud.
I've been working on my YouTube channel for a couple of years.
This SF2, I got to a few hundred.
I went from like maybe 300 to 700 subscribers,
and I actually started to monetize it.
My biggest fear was basically, will monetizing
make it less fun?
It did make it less fun.
And that definitely comes down to like,
trying to find an authentic relationship with the sponsors.
I'm trying to find something that feels like
I'm still creating what I wanna create
and that is actually authentic.
Yeah, I'm still learning a lot about that,
but I was just wondering if you had
anything else to say about that.
Yeah, yeah, so thanks for sharing that by the way.
I think it's like always interesting
to hear people's perspectives,
but in case anyone didn't hear what his question was,
it was basically like,
when it comes to monetizing your content,
do you often also have the feeling of like,
oh, this doesn't feel as fun.
So how do you find the balance of still doing these things and having fun?
I think for me, I've definitely started to see that as well.
Where I remember with one of my first sponsored things,
it was my first time creating stuff with creative constraints basically.
Because obviously sponsors and things like that,
they have certain rules or certain constraints that they want you to follow.
And so it was the first time in a while that I felt a little bit creatively
constrained, and so I definitely felt that.
I think that one thing that helps with that, like you said, is just one,
having a really good relationship with the brand and just being really picky
and selective with who you collaborate with.
So again, I guess it really depends on your goals at the end of the day
and if content is your main source of income.
But for me, at least I try to be very selective and work with brands
that either I currently use or really care about,
because I think it's inevitable that you're going to run into those creative constraints.
But I try to look at them as creative challenges and just like ways to think differently
because as much as I know about how my style works now and kind of how I like to create,
it is kind of cool sometimes to just like experiment and try creating things through
the lens of what a brand wants.
But yeah, obviously not as fun as creating stuff completely unrestricted.
So one of the things that I really struggle with is sticking to like a cadence and like
actually following through.
Like I'll write like a routine like, okay, I'm going to post this day, this day, this
day.
But like, I don't know, I just can't follow it for some reason.
I'm not sure if you have experience with that or like if you do, then like what advice would
you give to someone kind of struggling with it?
Yeah.
So the question was basically how do you stay consistent?
how do you keep going with our recurring sort of like schedule I think the biggest thing is being
realistic with yourself and I think that a lot of the times it just comes down to like making sure
that that cadence is something that is realistic with our current lifestyle as well I think it's
again really easy to see people who are doing like these daily challenges or these different things
that makes us feel pressured to follow in that kind of pattern but I think the most important thing
is let's say you're posting every three days or something,
and you're finding that you're still struggling with that,
maybe you try once a week or once every other week,
just some sort of cadence,
even if it's a bit wider of a cadence,
and then from there slowly start to close the gap
as you get more comfortable with that cadence.
Yeah, that's good advice, thank you.
So obviously, you've been creating content for about a year now,
you said. How did you find the start of your journey?
How did you get the momentum to keep going?
Yeah. So the question was,
how did I get started my journey and find the initial push to start?
I think for me, the biggest thing was I actually had wanted to create content for the past decade.
It's been something that like I've always really looked up to different YouTubers.
Like I feel like everyone kind of has a similar childhood where they just watch like their favorite YouTubers and they're like, oh, it would be cool to live that kind of life.
And so I think for me, I had always wanted to start creating, especially throughout university.
But I was just really shy and I was really scared of what my classmates or peers around me would think.
And so I purposely waited for after I graduated to actually get started because I knew it was reducing some of the variability of having to show up to class every day and wonder what people were thinking.
And so for me, personally, at least, that was a decision that I made to wait until after I graduated to then start creating.
And I think Buildspace was also a big push for that, right?
Like being surrounded by other people who are also trying to do different things.
I think that was really helpful in just helping me get started and push forward and actually create that first video.
Yes, Jeff.
Can you tell us a little bit more about when you found Adrian's community?
Like what was the unlock there? Was it just a feedback or was it just like
combination of different things? Was it, what was the unlock of finding
Adrian's community? Yeah, like finding the right people. Yeah, I think the biggest
thing wasn't even the feedback, because to be honest there wasn't a lot of feedback
that I received from him. I think it was just the feeling of like finally being
seen and finally feeling like I was around people who were chasing after
similar goals in a way that was most aligned with my niche because like yes
for example like technically in build space I was around other content creators
as well but the type of content that I was making was a little bit more like
niche or specific and so finding people who were creating those niche specific
things was really interesting and so I remember on that day that I was like on
that work review stream and I was watching other projects but also like
him watching mine, I just remember I felt so inspired after that because it just kind
of pushed the bounds of what is possible, just seeing how talented those other people
were and wanting to also chase that bar of quality.
You mentioned BuildSpace being a big boost and given that SF2 is almost over basically,
Maybe we have a couple weeks left.
I notice, well, when SF1 ended, I saw a few people from SF1
posting on Twitter about how depressing it was,
and the transition was super hard.
So I guess do you have any advice for us when Buildspace
ends how to transition back?
Yeah, that's a good question.
That's a very good question.
So yeah, the question was basically,
do you have any advice for transitioning out of SF2
SF1 and into the real world again. I think the biggest thing is I was talking to Ahmed about
this actually recently but I feel like after a program like this it's very much so like sink or
swim. You know you kind of see some people either continue on the same path or they just kind of go
back into whatever like their their life before SF1 or 2 looked like and so I think there's like a
few different pieces of advice that I'd give. One of them for sure is just keep in touch with the
people who you've like grown close to in your cohort. I think that like even some of the people
who I sat around back there I still keep in touch with and we still chat regularly and so I think
it's really really hard to find that type of community sometimes and so just making sure that
you put in the time to prioritize that and keep in touch with those people I think that's the
thing that'll at least sustain some of that momentum and motivation a little bit longer.
but I think another thing too that is really important is I think the transition out of like
the Buildspace school or Buildspace SF2 is really important and necessary. I think that as much as at
the time I was like oh I wish I could keep doing this forever I think that if I didn't go back to
my hometown go back into like regular life I don't think I would have stumbled across like what I have
now because I think being alone again kind of forced me to look at things in a different way
Because when I was in this environment, I was very much so just like on a grind every
single week and it was really, really hard again to zoom out and see the bigger picture.
And so when I finally graduated from the school, I think I was able to have a little bit more
clarity and see the full picture because I actually had time to slow down and reflect
on what was going on.
So I think afterwards definitely take time to just think about everything that happened
and think about what you want moving forward.
I think that's the biggest thing.
So I've kind of more of like a, I guess like technical like when you're creating videos
questions. So I feel like you do a really good job of like making it feel like a really
intimate conversation like with the viewer through the camera. I feel like sometimes
when I make videos talking to the camera like it's like quite obvious I'm just like talking
to a camera. So what are some like tactics you use for filming or speaking to kind of
like create that intimate feeling?
Yeah, that's a good question. I think it's very, very hard at the start to feel natural talking in front of a camera. It's something that I definitely struggled with a lot, especially in the early days. I remember I couldn't even like look at the camera lens because it felt weird because it was just like I'm looking into some black hole right now. But honestly, I think it's just one of those things where it just takes like putting in the reps to get used to it.
And so I think for me, like even when I first started the 23 Lessons series, it would take me a full day to just film the video, not even edit it.
It would take me a full day to film it and then another full day to edit it.
Now I can get the whole process down in like maybe three or four hours.
But a lot of that just came from getting like practice in and just continuing to show up and do it.
So there are going to be a lot of times where you cringe and you're just like, oh, and you're there will be days where you're frustrated.
and you literally take the same clip like 20 times.
But that's okay because that's just part of the process.
And over time, it does eventually get smoother and easier.
How do you leverage ChatGBT in your creation process?
I do not currently.
I used to play around with it a little bit like I remember when GPT's started becoming like a really big thing
I made like a thumbnail sort of like advice giver to just like help me pick between two thumbnails or like two titles for YouTube videos
But at the moment no, I don't use it at all. I think
Like to touch on my creative process a little bit
The way that I come up with ideas now
Oftentimes is just on the fly and so I think that like having backlogs of ideas and things like that
that, what I end up finding happening is that they just
accumulate.
And I just have all these stale ideas that go dry.
Because if I don't act on them right away,
I lose the initial interest and inspiration behind them.
And so that's why using Chachapiti for ideas
doesn't really work for me, just because I'm someone
who really thinks about things on the fly,
and then from there tries to act on them as soon as possible.
So yeah.
Thank you.
Yeah.
So I relate with you a lot on the thing that like ideas get stale, like pretty fast for me.
I'm also pretty intuitive and like I want myself to be interested in the process as well.
That's why I have like so many files, like 30 to 40 production files that like I started working on,
like, but I just did not complete them.
and my challenge is that I love to work intuitively and on the fly but what's the
mindset like to still be consistently putting stuff out or consistently being intuitive and
open to the process of ideas coming to your head yeah that's a good question um
I don't know how to summarize that question so I'm just going to answer it
But I would say I actually faced that recently.
So I was trying to get back into creating more YouTube videos because again I've been
really focused on Instagram for the past little bit.
And I remember I have all this old footage back from Japan and there's so many videos that I still want to create from that footage.
But as many times as I sit down and try to edit it, it just stays there forever.
And it just leaves me feeling kind of shitty because I'm just like why can I not push this out there?
out there like i know i like the idea why can't i get it out there and so um something that i did
recently was i remember on the fly i just came up with another idea that was like completely unrelated
and i was just like you know what i'm just gonna make this video instead and just release this so
at least like it helps me get back into the momentum of posting again um and i can always
decide afterwards if i still want to keep those old ideas or honestly just start fresh and keep
making like new things on the fly and so I think yeah trust your intuition and
follow what feels easiest for you because those ideas again if they really
are something that you want to create and put out there you'll eventually find
time for them again but I think that there's something really powerful of
that initial like activation energy of finding a new idea and being excited
about it and that I think leads to the best results because again you're not
overthinking it you're just kind of going based off of what you think is
best as an artist. Yeah. Can you touch a bit more on your creative process, like how you go from
idea to like finish video and like kind of how long it takes and like what what your steps are?
Yeah, yeah. So the question was about like what is my creative process and kind of how I go from
idea to actual video. I think it's definitely been something that I thought about a lot over time,
but I think right now what it kind of looks like is basically
So earlier this year again in the whole spirit of like trying to keep things fun
I don't have a pretty like good system
So I have no really good answer for what this looks like so if it sounds like scattered and disorganized
That's why I even tried like creating notions or like things like that
But honestly like my creative process right now is just contained in a chaos of my Apple notes
Because usually what will happen is again like if I have an idea and oftentimes
it's like at night when I'm in bed I will literally just start typing up what
that idea is and what I do first is I'll write down a script and so basically
like talking points what exactly is it that I'll say and usually I'll be able
to like finish a whole script in maybe like 30 minutes or so and then I'll go
to bed look at it the next morning see if anything like I need to fix or if it
still resonates with me and then I'll try to film it in the next day or two
but actually the step between like the script and filming what I'll then do
after I have like each line in the script is I'll literally just put another line
above each script line that says what's the shot that I'm trying to like take
with it and so that way when I go to film I kind of have in mind all the
shots already planned because for me at least if I go out and film without that
then it's really really hard and it takes like double the time if I don't
know what I'm shooting so yeah that's pretty much like the creative process of
that and then from there I'll just go edit in DaVinci and then yeah that's
pretty much the process I guess what is one thing people get wrong about content
creation when getting started on what is one thing people get wrong when getting
started on creating content um let's see honestly I think it goes back to what I
was saying in the presentation earlier I think it makes sense but I think it also
like is a hindrance where people just think a lot about what can I make that
will add value to others because they think that them just showing up and I'm
just creating something isn't going to be valuable enough for people to pay
attention and so they start to over optimize and think a little bit too much
about how they can create something that will appeal to the masses rather than
what will actually appeal to themselves and so I think that's where again it's
really important to just think about what is actually interesting to you and
you kind of do just have to have that like self belief that what you're saying
matters and people will care about it like if you think about it there's like
a bunch of really random stuff on the internet like stuff that goes viral for
no reason and so as long as you have that belief in yourself that what you're
putting out there will be valuable eventually over time the right people
will find you you just have to keep showing up and so yeah I think that's
probably the biggest thing that I see people go wrong is they're creating for
other people and not themselves.
Awesome, thank you.
So you said you spent like 10 years
kind of thinking about it and everything.
And I don't think you really tackle
very controversial stuff or anything,
but was any part of that a fear of people criticizing
or dealing with hate or any of that stuff?
And if so, have you created any ways
to deal with that sort of aspect of things?
That's a good question.
Yeah, so it's basically around, like, how do you deal with hate or have I ever worried
about dealing with hate and things like that?
I think it's definitely been something that I've thought about before.
I've never really dealt with any, like, really bad hate.
I think, like, being a founder in, like, a past life, I think I've faced probably more
hate or, like, potentially controversial things from that.
But I think, again, at the end of the day, it just, like, goes back down to remembering
why you're creating something in the first place and then just trying to stay
true to that I think a big part of it is like the self-confidence piece and kind
of getting yourself to a place where again you just have such a strong
conviction as to what you're creating and why you're creating that even if
people are hating on it or they're saying things you're still very very
stuck on that why and and how I guess I don't know that's a good answer but yeah
For the series you're creating now, if you consider it a cake, what is the thing that
you've been experimenting with the most?
So, I guess I'll go process of elimination of what I think I've been experimenting with
the most.
Script-wise, I feel for the most part I talk in a very similar style for every single video
and kind of what that looks like.
So I think for me it's like visuals and the order of the visuals.
I think that's like the main thing that I experiment with.
And so whether that's like including the hook at the beginning or like putting some kind
of question at the end to make people thinking or looping the video so that like they keep
watching it.
I think it's really just like the structure of the video and the visuals that I overlay.
Like something that I thought about a lot is there are a lot of cuts in my videos now
in a sense that there's so many angles and so many different things happening.
I have been very curious about testing out whether or not
if I stripped away all those visuals and changes,
would people still stick around just for the actual narrative in the story?
And so that's something that I'm actually trying to experiment with recently
is if I post a video that's just me talking and there's not a bunch of cuts,
what will happen?
So I think, yeah, that's kind of what I experiment with most
is just the visuals and the order in which they show.
Thank you.
Apart from Instagram, YouTube, and that work with video, like workspace, whatever it was,
what are some of the other avenues that you use to connect with people?
I think also another avenue that I use to connect with people is probably just going to in-person events and things like that.
So I guess this depends on what city you live in, but usually there are little pockets of creators in different areas.
And so I think trying to find those in-person events is really important.
So, yeah, I think a lot of it is just like searching.
I think with any new platform, there's always that feeling of like, oh, this is like a really new platform.
I don't really know how to navigate it or who exists in this space
But the more that you like actively seek those things the more you'll start to notice the same names
And to me like that's kind of the indicator of like oh
I kind of am starting to understand this niche or this circle is when I'm starting to hear people know the same names or like the same people
And so I think that's kind of like a good indicator of like when you've started to really close in on that that niche and
found that like kind of community there
the interesting thing with me right now actually is
I don't know this one like it's something that's still like half baked of a thought in my head too
but something I've been thinking about about recently a lot is just like right now I'm actually
trying to distance myself a little bit from the niche that I've been in just because I think that
like again in order to find my style and be creative as much as I love watching the people
who inspire me I've been trying to just like kind of go into my own little cave and try to figure
out what styles like and ideas i can come up completely on my own because i think like again
it's kind of like that thing where if you're in a friend group you start to adopt the same little
like things nuances of how you speak and so i'm trying to actually like go on that kind of journey
right now of just like separating myself from the community a little bit and seeing what i can come
up with completely on my own without outside influence yeah so kind of a different take too
on community, I guess.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Thank you for listening.
