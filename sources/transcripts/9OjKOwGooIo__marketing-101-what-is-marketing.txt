So welcome to DMW Lecture Officially 1, Marketing 101.
I believe all of you know something about marketing.
I mean, you're here after all.
So you have done some of this.
And today I just want to leave you with four frameworks
to kind of think about, to anchor you for the next,
is it 10 weeks now?
How many weeks?
We should have like a counter.
Okay.
I brought these two questions because the past three seasons,
this conversation always kind of comes up and feel free to answer like what you
think you know is marketing really just content these days any thoughts hot takes
mostly okay what do you think what do you think of that Josh marketing is just
content he's like I'm filming okay
What is the word messaging?
Messaging and content the same thing?
We can get into it, right?
The next one, the next common one.
Is marketing just about building an audience these days?
What do you guys think?
It's all the same thing?
I mean, there are tons of brands which everyone loves,
but they don't necessarily have an audience.
And they're doing something, right?
So they're exceptions, I would say.
I think marketing is more about reaching more people and reaching unknown people,
more than just building an audience.
You build an audience with the actual content,
but I feel like you just reach a wider audience with marketing.
Okay.
I think with a big enough audience,
you can have a degree of credibility and influence,
but whether you need the right audience to actually ship product and make money.
Okay.
I want you to start thinking about, when you think about marketing, there should be an action
component.
I think that's a really good way to think about it.
So if I were to say what marketing is, I'd say it's a compelling way to share what you're
doing with the world.
That's the first part.
So you're kind of thinking there's content involved, there's those aspects building audience,
right?
And get people to do the thing you want them to do.
I think that's a really important thing about marketing.
So Buildspace makes content.
A lot of it is also marketing and trying to get people
to do something.
Some of you are making content, but you're not necessarily
getting people to do something besides following.
So I want you to start thinking about the actions
that you want people to take whenever you specifically
kind of do marketing.
So I want to get into the four frameworks.
Let's look at this.
I want to start out with this video.
How many of you have seen this?
Yeah, let me just, let me play this.
And also, if you guys want more,
we just keep watching the whole thing.
I'm inheriting 46 billion dollars from a man I've never met before.
And that's billions with a B.
You guys want to watch more?
Yeah. Okay.
I live with my step-sister in New England.
Actually, I really live in my car because her boyfriend's crazy.
I love my sister to death, but he is wild.
One day I'm at school and this absolute...
Okay, okay. I'm not going to go through, okay?
Bunch of you said, yes, I want to watch more. Why?
I want to know more.
I want to know how to pick up the phone.
Okay. Let me show you the ending of this video.
Try to kill me. That's a very real possibility, but I could really use $46 billion.
And that's not my life, but it is the plot of this book.
The Inheritance Games by Jennifer Lynn Barnes.
It's a trilogy and I just read it in literally three days.
It's incredible.
So you should read it.
Okay.
Some of you are like, man, I feel rugged.
But I feel the same way too.
This is, let's set this low.
You know I'm Jeffrey N. though.
I have a group text with Stavon and Farza.
Stavon sent this.
I'm like, son of a, I thought this might not be real.
But honestly, I was like, this could be real.
But yeah, this book just sold out fast, and it was kind of like a side project.
But I want to show you this.
Wait, was it her book?
No, this is just some other person marketing a book.
And 6.3 million views, pretty good.
And really, what I want to talk about is what made this good.
I feel I already gave the answer away.
What made it good?
The hook.
Yeah?
The hook?
Tell me more.
Like you cannot not keep on watching it.
You have to get the answer.
Yeah.
Shock.
Shock?
Shock factor.
Yeah.
So the first thing I want you to think about, all of you know this,
but I want to just surface all of these things you already know
to the top of your head when you're thinking about this,
is curiosity gap.
All of these frameworks are aimed to get some kind of emotion
from somebody.
So for curiosity gap, the emotion, it should be,
I must know what's next.
So that's pretty interesting.
Also, I just brought this up.
How many of you use TikTok?
I think all of you use TikTok, right?
Or IG?
How many of you, when you post something,
you go and study a lot of the comments?
If you're not doing that, you should study all the comments.
The comments on TikTok and IG tells you a lot about
how people are thinking about things,
how they're reacting, and you know, whoa.
Yeah, you can go find this video
and study people's reactions.
Remember Spotify wrapped?
How many of you have Spotify?
All of you go through wrapped?
Yeah.
Yeah, and see like, this is really interesting, right?
This immediately builds curiosity gap.
So a lot of times during this lecture,
I want to show you something that's more content marketing
than something that's more on the product side,
so that way we can kind of hit all of you, right?
So curiosity gap shows you a number,
and then it asks, will this year's number be higher or lower?
Instantly, you're interested.
Let's look at what's next.
OK.
Let's look at the next one.
Again, we'll do it the same way.
If you want to watch more, we will watch more.
If not, we don't have to.
How many of you watch or play football slash soccer?
How many of you just, I do not care about sports?
OK.
That's okay, that's a minority of the group, so it's fine.
No, not like that.
Okay, let's watch this.
But his head is always like this.
He's always moving.
Watch more?
Yeah.
Okay.
Messi is known mostly for what he's able to do with his feet.
but it's something that he does with his head that's equally important.
Scanning is a skill performed by almost all footballers.
It's when a player temporarily looks away from the ball to take in extra information
that can help them once they receive it.
Now, when we measure scanning, we look at something called scan rate.
This is how many times a player scans in the 10 seconds before they receive the ball.
Studies have shown that the higher the scan rate, the more likely you are to make a successful forward pass.
Messi scans an average of five times in the 10 seconds before receiving the ball.
The average Premier League forward does this just 2.8 times, making Messi almost twice as good.
In the World Cup Final versus France, Messi scanned the field an unbelievable...
I'm gonna pause right there. While I'm constantly observing you,
most of the non-football soccer lovers are like,
tell me more about Lionel Messi. It's kind of interesting, right?
So then it goes through and it educates you on all these things.
And then...
...brain and improve your partner.
And that's exactly what we specialize in here at Be Your Best,
with our VR technology helping thousands of players around the world
to become palmer on the ball.
Be Your Best is designed to improve...
So this whole video, again, is a product, right?
But what's really interesting was we actually watched this at Stavans Place last year,
last year and we just like to learn more about Messi,
we're playing a lot of FIFA, and this video hooked us in
because we want to know what made Messi great, right?
So what framework do you think these people are playing on?
Yeah.
Did she do something?
Yeah, I count all of this as a framework of storytelling.
And we will come back to storytelling more,
I think there's something that you need to think about
is that anytime you're doing storytelling
for most of your stuff, it should be,
the emotion is, oh, I can understand this,
I can relate this, right?
So you take something that's educational,
you turn it into a story, now you can remember.
And now all of you are gonna leave,
and if somebody asks, what makes Lionel Messi great?
You're gonna be like, well, actually,
what makes him great is his scanning.
Do you know about scanning?
Like, maybe I could just imagine
telling me something about this, right?
So that's a really important framework as well.
Millennials and Gen Zers.
Anybody seen this?
Let me show you another one.
This one's also really interesting.
Millennials and Gen Zers
would rather be unemployed than unhappy in a job.
According to the study, Gen Z and millennials
are putting their happiness at home
over your careers when 56% of Gen Zers
This ain't how it's supposed to be
before it forget all the forest in the A
So, uh, I showed this one.
It's also really interesting. As you look at all these examples, you should know
like they kind of, all these frameworks build upon each other, right?
framework, it's contrast, right?
Now obviously, I don't think this is,
I want to really count this as marketing,
this is just content, right?
I want to show an example of how this person
has baked in, number one,
curiosity gap, because once you see,
why do I say this bakes in a curiosity gap?
Any thoughts?
Yeah.
you see the mic, and once you see the background,
then it's kind of just like, why is,
what does the video have to do with it?
And it also helps because we can relate to the video.
It says like, millennials, whatever, Gen Z.
Yeah, I think what's really interesting is like,
you see some kind of news,
and they're about to tell you about these two things.
You instantly want to know, okay,
what is Fox News gonna say about millennials and Gen Z, right?
And then what you're actually bringing out is contrast.
You rarely see this kind of stuff.
So it instantly pulls you in.
And then the storytelling is baked into the song
that he's doing itself.
But so the emotion of contrast is like, damn,
I've never seen anything like this.
Stop you again.
But oh, the slide got deleted.
One important thing though is you don't always want to have contrast because sometimes depending on your niche having contrast is actually not a good thing
But you can also take the familiarity and build upon that so let me show you another example of
KO anybody know KO boxing?
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, Labib's a founder. He's also part of founders Inc. and let me show you
So almost all of you have seen this kind of content on IG or TikTok, right?
You're very familiar with it.
So in this case, they're not really doing contrast.
They're taking advantage of the fact that you're familiar with this.
How many punches do you think you can throw within 10 seconds?
I would say about 50.
All right, well, I got an app called here, Kyle.
You can find the app store.
All right, I'll give you a countdown.
Three, two, one, go.
Oh, shit. Keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going.
Three, two, keep going, keep going. One.
Good shit.
How much do you think you threw?
I feel confident, man. 600.
Well, you actually threw 45.
You might just have to ask for it. It's called Kaio.
Right?
Again, immediately curiosity gap.
I'm not even counting my punches.
I don't remember last time I threw a punch.
but I'm gonna be like, man, I mean, I wouldn't be lying
if I said I was in my room.
After this, I stood up and I threw some punches
to see how fast I am, right?
All right, dang, I ruined it.
Let's say you're launching a product,
just taking what you know.
You're launching a product on IG,
you know on IG you can swipe on the shop.
Which one would you guys pick as a first image?
This one?
No.
This one?
No.
Bottom left?
Yes.
Why?
Just yell out at me.
It's different.
Innovate change.
It's different than the rest of it.
It stands out.
OK, this stands out from the rest of it.
But what about like, think about it, right?
The people, they're looking at all kinds of products on IG.
Say my team.
Say what?
It's clean? This one?
I don't feel like I'm being sold to or shown a product.
Yeah.
Like on a subconscious level.
It's art as opposed to here's the product.
Like I already know on the other three that like...
Yeah.
It's kind of just showing one product which is different from other pictures
which are showing like a bunch of different things.
Yeah, no there's only two things on the screen.
and it's just fabric and like,
fabulous stuff.
Yeah.
And that's exactly
what they pick, right?
I think what's really interesting about
this again is that
you have seen this kind of layout
on Instagram all the time.
Whereas if you put a pin, it instantly
becomes interesting, but
I don't think this
will always work, but this has
they're building on icon, you know
Everyone's seeing everything everywhere at once.
This is kind of an iconic shot.
So yeah.
OK.
Let's get to a slightly boring one, actually one of my favorites.
How many of you are building like SaaS, things like that?
Non-content.
Raise your hand.
Yeah.
We're really going to dive into this as well.
How do you provide people value?
Somebody give me an example of your one-liner,
if you're building a SAS product.
Just anybody.
Go ahead.
It's a tool to manage your cloud using code.
OK.
So the value problem is like, if I knew code, it's pretty clear.
Right?
This, you usually want to be as specific as possible.
So what do you think of this so far?
Would you click?
Who said they would click?
I know some people just click on whatever.
How about this?
100%.
100%.
Who said that?
Did you say 100%?
Yeah, 100%.
Why?
Because it paints a picture.
Like, it paints a picture for what it is that is actually
being offered.
Yeah.
Also for free, right?
Don't be shy if you're offering something that saves people
time or money.
Do not be shy about that.
What about this?
Why am I losing slides?
Hold on.
Doesn't matter.
What about this one?
How many of you have seen this copy?
This copy is so popular, please.
I don't want to see any of this copy here.
If in week five I see this, I'm going to chat with you privately and also comment.
What about this one?
That's good.
Why?
It's very to the point of the other one, the one before.
It was very broad and convenient.
It doesn't tell us what's about this.
It's very to the point that it said, okay, this is the solution that shows exactly what's about.
Yeah.
I also like that it included numbers, like thousands.
It gives you a sense of what you're going to get, like really expressively.
Yeah.
Let's take a one minute break.
minute break. I need to find a link. Sorry, what is this? No, I think it's here.
Okay, break time's over. Let's get back to it.
I was struggling to get your job this morning.
You've not been able to see that.
How many of you have seen this?
How many of you use like Pomodoro method to study or whatever?
Right? Many of you.
This is also a really good one.
I also love the fact that they learn more in less time.
So who is this targeted towards?
Students.
Yeah, students, right?
I mean everything is targeted towards students.
So I think this is actually pretty good.
Well, first off, the design of product is very simple.
And then it just lay out all of the value props.
Let's look in the next part.
How many of you are based in SF before coming to SF2?
How many of you, when you first came to SF,
you were kind of enamored with the fact
that you have Uber ads, you have Notion billboards,
you have Tesla, like, it's so interesting, right?
I think when you start walking around,
it's kind of like what Salvin said,
eyes open at all times, start taking note SF examples.
Here are some examples I took that caught my eye.
I realize the first one you're gonna ask
why they caught my eye, but anyways.
Have you guys seen any of these kinds of things on the streets?
Right?
Would you go?
How many would you go through this?
Really?
It's a straight recorder.
Why would you be judged?
Okay, well that's my phone number, Michael.
I'm just kidding.
This is not my phone number.
This is not compelling.
How could we improve this actually?
Just like a street one, yeah?
Make it $20.
$20 off.
It already says free items.
What else?
Mushrooms are dangerous, or not dangerous,
but should be an exercise of caution.
And that's just so simple.
It's like, I'm going to get drunk.
Yeah, I forgot that we're being recorded.
I'm going to move on to the next example.
We can have a DMW 1.5.
What's up?
Well, I was just going to say, yeah, for the degree of seriousness that therapy entails,
it looks pretty spammy.
So how are you?
That's a good point.
Yeah.
It's also black and white.
What's the problem with that?
I just feel like it's a cheap print.
Oh, right then?
It just feels very busy.
Like, I don't really know where to look.
Yeah, that's one point, right?
Like, one thing that we're also getting into is when you think about marketing, it's actually
combo of design and writing all together and this could use a lot of visual
hierarchy to make this better. Yeah? It also doesn't provide like the value proposition explicitly. It just says like it's a therapy but you don't know if you don't have any background like what benefits you'll get out of it.
Yeah. How about this one?
Oh I've seen that one.
Who? Who said that?
I want to go to it.
Why do you want to go to it?
Why do you want to go to it?
I walk past it every day and I see the, it's chill and wholesome.
That's what got me.
Yeah, who else?
It's interesting.
I'm kind of interested.
I actually took a picture, so I didn't go, but at least I took a picture of it, so I
count that as I clicked it.
It's chill and wholesome.
When we get into writing, we're going to start talking about, like, I don't want to
busy with like brand voice or all of those things, but just they have a brand voice already.
It's as simple as it's showing wholesome.
Sorry, somebody else raise their hand.
I mean, with the order and the way that it's laid out,
it actually kind of looks like a book cover,
which is like a super familiar format.
And that is actually what I wouldn't expect from the poster.
Yeah.
It looks like a book, but it's actually a poster.
I also love that I caught a major vibe.
I'm like, dude, this is a watercolor class.
What kind of major vibes are you catching?
I want to go.
How about this one?
How many of this one are just like, damn, this got me?
Right, all people know how to code, right?
I love this one because there's so many billboards here,
all with AI just blasting it.
But it's targeted towards developers.
But developers, no, just NPM AI.
That's cool.
Again, that's Vercel again.
I don't know about that.
That's pretty cool.
You know, I think they took inspo from us, which is
probably why it's pretty cool.
They've actually updated this one because I've seen it.
And it just says now the copy is what would you build?
Yeah.
And I actually didn't like that.
It's like, would you ship really quickly?
Yeah, yeah, what did you ship?
That was really cool.
What would you ship?
Sorry.
Yeah.
I feel like for the simplicity one at the bottom,
you have to have a popular brand or .
Yeah, that's true.
So we're almost done.
Told you this will be done in 45 minutes.
So just kind of want to reframe this.
And then actually, Stav and I are going
to review some of the things that you have shipped.
Just want to bring this back home.
There are many more frameworks.
But these are kind of the four that stands out to us
when we think about marketing specifically.
And I want you to take these frameworks,
but I want you to start thinking of them as ingredients.
And sometimes you want to emphasize one taste over another.
Like if you're cooking a ribeye steak,
you might want it to just be ribeye steak.
So that might just be the value prop.
You want to cut down noises on the other things.
Sometimes it's a harmony of all of them.
But I just want to leave you with a thought.
Explore all the ingredients that make up your dish,
where you go out to make this.
Don't limit yourself to just those four.
There's plenty more.
But those are kind of first kind of like meaty four parts.
Any questions so far before we go into review stuff?
Yes.
So you guys laid out these four, as you say,
frameworks for us.
What does the process in your head look like when you're
deciding on what a new framework is for you?
So when you're looking at a bunch of content,
and you're like, oh, I'm actually noticing this pattern.
This pattern is making me feel a certain way.
Like, how do you go about knowing when you should actually
figure that out and codify it for yourself?
Yeah, I think that's a really good question.
I'll let Spavan speak to you.
But I think most of us, whenever we're actually
going out to make stuff, we're not actually thinking, oh,
this check curiosity box.
This checks this.
This makes sense when you reflect backwards.
It's like an analysis tool when you go look at, oh,
Why did this go viral?
Then you can start to break down what makes sense.
When you're actually making it, if it's not working,
then you can use the framework to see, OK,
this is not doing anything because it's actually not
doing any of these things.
Yes?
I want to ask you more about curiosity gap,
because I think about that a lot.
And when you showed that example there,
I was saying, my first thought was,
oh, I want to watch because I want to know how it's going
to disappoint me.
At what point is it maybe damaging or you're setting a precedent for people to give or to brand me using curiosity gaps and stuff?
I don't know. I wonder if you have any thoughts about that.
Yeah, I think the book one, those kind of have like, you feel like you're rubbed because you got,
this is a point that we're going to drive home constantly is whenever you go on a platform,
you have a different mindset on a platform, right?
If you're on LinkedIn, you're looking for opportunities.
If you're on TikTok, you're looking to be entertained.
And that one, although it's really good for you,
it might feel like I got rugged, right?
But then it depends on platform, but also your audience.
So for example, the Lionel Messi one, the one with football,
I didn't feel rugged.
I was like, wow, this is actually really cool technology
that somebody built this based off of study of players.
Yeah?
According to you, what leads to a word of mouth around the product?
Because there are some times when I'm like, I love this song or I love this product.
But then there are other times, oh my God, I love this product.
You know what?
I'm going to talk to Braden about it.
I'm going to talk to Abel about it.
So what do you think breaks that threshold of you talking to other people about it?
I think it's kind of hard.
You can design shareability.
And we'll kind of talk about this, that some things are designed where it's so easily shareable with somebody else.
A lot of times, I think for me when it comes to word of mouth, the thing needs to immediately have a pretty strong voice.
And then it needs to feel different enough, you're like, yo, check this out.
What do you think, Stalin?
Your song's a good example, right?
I fought with it, you shared it with me yesterday.
I shared it with four of my friends.
One of them didn't like it, but she gave me really good feedback on why she didn't like it.
Now I probably didn't see the doctor, obviously.
But then the other two people sent it to two of their other friends.
This happened.
So with music specifically, it's like,
if you're excited for the next time when you're driving the car and your buddies are with you
and you can't wait to play that song and expose that for them,
I think that in itself is a testament to how good your music is.
And it's not always going to hit a chord with all of your audience,
but even if it strikes a chord with a subset of the audience, that subset will continue to talk about that.
So that's in real life.
But that can also be translated to TikTok.
People will save that sound, people will share that sound.
We do that all the time.
And the number one thing, the most important thing is they just got to vibe with it.
And ultimately, we overcomplicate a lot of these things in our heads.
And even the question that you asked regarding curiosity gap, it's ultimately like trust.
They trust you to put out a bank or content, and that's not built in one day.
It's going to be built over time.
So just keep continuing to work on building that trust with them.
And if you're building that trust, being authentic and honest with them, you can take that really, really far.
They'll actually cheer you on to fuck up so that they can be there to support you.
And you see that with even so many big creators as well, where the world cancels them,
but they can continue to keep grinding and come back even bigger, better, and stronger.
Logan Paul's trip to Japan is a perfect example.
He's still relevant today because he had that cool audience that really understood and appreciated the message and how he was growing as an individual
because people are bound to fuck up.
I think one thing with artistic stuff too, how many of you have seen the game Hotline Miami?
What about this band called Windows 96?
Oh, you know Windows 96?
Yeah.
Okay, I bring these two up, you're like,
those are really obscure examples.
I brought obscure examples because those are kind of
cult classics, and there's something really interesting
about cult classics, is that cult classics,
again, don't uncomplicate it, but there's one thing about it,
you feel like it's made for you.
You feel that about Windows 96?
A little bit, yeah.
Yeah, you just feel like, wow, this person made this for me.
And then it's like, that's kind of how that game
and also that band just keeps getting shared,
keeps getting shared.
I've got a huge following, but it's like, it lasted a decade.
So yeah.
All right.
I'll look at some.
Yeah, one more question.
You said the contrast framework doesn't apply to .
I think, well, the one that I can always think is academic.
The academic crowd is a niche that things need to look official.
So if you stand out too much, it's just not going to work, right?
Kind of like Unriddle's early days, I feel like it worked really well.
Because it looks, you guys all know Unriddle.
That product looks like something that a legit researcher would use.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I just want to ask you,
the video ads you showed us through the messaging print,
at what point does it become too giving to everyone?
Because the messy video you showed and the one before that as well,
it's like too general in the beginning, right?
Which one?
Like the messy video and also the previous one.
Because not everyone's going to buy the product, right?
So it's like they're not targeting people,
like filtering it out initially.
But then there's also some ads that do video ads
that maybe like straight up say, hey, whatever,
like targeting the people that they want.
So like which ones better?
Or is it just like different ways of approach?
I think it's different ways of approach.
It's interesting to say that.
I actually thought those two were very niche.
Like a.
Do you hear knows funnels?
Who has never heard of like, what is tofu mean?
Top of funnel?
Yeah, so it's essentially like, they're
just taking place in your bank.
If a million people watch it, 10% convert
to even checking out your website to 10% of that converting.
And that's kind of like, let's just make the total
like really, really big.
And that may not even be like from your main page.
You can like connect and collaborate
with many other influencers that can do that for you
and make some good example of that.
I think another reason not to filter people
at the beginning is that people know other people.
So I might watch that and be like, I don't play soccer,
but I would just hang out with a friend who was talking
about how my team loves soccer,
and I might then say, this part was really interesting.
So I've watched this part,
and they start showing the VR video,
like okay, this is not really for me,
but I might share it with a friend.
So I think, yeah, just don't filter too early.
I think sometimes people have to argue this,
and then immediately you're limited
who's gonna have to see that.
Yeah.
I think one, that brings up a really good point.
You're probably willing to share it
because that video has a lot of value.
That video intrinsically has a lot of value.
Whatever you guys create, even if you're creating a TikTok for your product, it should add values to people's lives.
That's something you've got to think about a lot.
It's not just so they can sell more stuff, but you're respecting the people who give you their attention.
And if you respect that, chances are you're going to reap benefits from that.
All these frameworks are hyper-extended.
Even though we showed a lot of videos and we talked about video a lot because that's our way of storytelling in many ways.
But last night I came across an ad from Jeep Wagoneer or something, their new electric truck.
I took a screenshot, Jeffrey's in the market for a new electric truck.
I sent it to him.
It's kind of like it applies to all different, how many times, well, I don't use email anymore,
but back in the day it's just forward emails all the time to my friends that make my volume something.
So think of marketing, right?
Marketing as a whole is like this orchestra.
and you are the conductor and all of these are different instruments that you can use to create
the perfect symphony. Video being one of them, content being another one, even like word of mouth
marketing being another one. So all of that kind of like encompasses what marketing is and we'll cover
as much of it as we can over the next.
Should we go through this? There's a mark here. If you're a 10th group.
He's not here.
He did post this video.
He shared this video with me.
I just want you guys to take a look at it.
I think he shipped it on TikTok, but we can talk about that briefly.
The thing for you.
If you want to play like Roger, check this out.
So if I were to just try and do this on Amazon, this is kind of what the results are looking like.
Not too great, as you can see.
I'm looking for a tennis racket for advanced players, but instead of showing me pickleball paddles and table tennis paddles, which are both sports I also love, but not exactly at all what I'm looking for.
So I'm going to show you how to do this 10 times better.
So I'm going to come over to Kleros and put in the same search as I did over on Amazon and see what happens.
okay so i've gotten some results and i'm getting back uh yonix and wilson pro staff
i own a wilson pro staff so i'm glad that is showing up but it's recommending the yonix feed
cord and here's the reason why and it's giving me the ability to basically customize and person
we can move on but it's kind of like the whole thing is like a minute and 56 seconds who would
scroll and at what point um right after he shows what it does i would scroll i don't like like i
feel like that's kind of the climax is like what's what's clear okay oh that's dope like because uh
right where we stopped it is kind of like okay now he's getting into tennis or something i don't know
I don't know anything about tennis.
So I think that, yeah, I hope that answers your question.
I think one of the first things he said was,
like, are you a tennis player?
Nope.
I would have just scrolled.
I think I scrolled.
As soon as he starts listening tennis on Amazon,
I'm just like, I'm not interested in this at all.
And then I get not very engaging.
Yeah, I churned from the WhatsApp video he sent me.
I churned.
I didn't even watch the whole thing.
The first two seconds, I don't know.
We'll review it, I guess.
I'll force everyone to watch it.
So the point is, get directly into the value proposition.
He waits hella long.
I was really happy with,
so if you look at how he starts,
do you know how to read that?
Well, I don't know.
But,
I made it even further.
So I have pretty big hands.
I made a new way to find the best products on Amazon, right?
And just go directly in it.
Or make it hyper-specific and not really kind of like drag on
for 30, 40 seconds of showing off the product.
And just pace.
The platform dictates your pace.
TikTok is super fast.
So you have essentially the hook needs
to be in the first three to five seconds, or you're fucked.
Yeah, but I was going to say, I think even the format,
it was really hard to see what he was looking at.
I think he could have made a more full-blown print.
Yeah.
I just thought, when you were doing the product,
it's hard to see what's being shown.
Yeah, and half of it is in landscape, and the other half is in .
When I saw the thumbnail, I was like, bro, he's, so TikTok has this new thing
where they're literally pushing landscape videos that are a minute and longer.
and longer.
So I was like, bro, he's learning.
But as soon as I clicked on it, I was like, fuck.
He's just fun.
He's just fun.
It's kind of like pick a path and just go with it.
What's interesting too is almost every season, people always come to Josh and I, just all
the team, like, how do I be funny?
And it's like, it's just, it's hard.
But the answer is, this is actually a really good example about the funnel is that if you
directly in the funnel of the top something you know here I can find
something on Amazon jump right in value prop doesn't cut out people like you
right you don't play tennis the next thing is like that's when humor could be
really good because not only are you capturing everyone because everybody
shots on Amazon you could find a product that's just hella funny and then now
the video becomes like 10x better yeah we talked about that thing this was
I love the video, everything's great.
I think just minor things, we'll talk about that next week.
A little foreshadowing here, I guess.
The contrast on this shit is atrocious.
You're already spending so much time creating the video.
It legit will take you like five minutes to make it so much more aesthetic.
Even though your purpose is not to show it to a lot of people.
But no, great stuff.
Mateo, should I take this?
So it? No, I just did my part.
Okay, cool.
All right, so how would you make, can you guys see that?
Let's make that a little bit bigger.
All right, how would you guys make this better?
It did pretty well, but we'll all talk about it.
But how can we improve upon this?
The developers, yeah?
Yeah.
Do the copy things a little bit long?
Like I don't know if I'm going to read that all.
Make the value of opposition and the .
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Just work with an eraser.
I always tell myself, like, even like, introducing AI generated dashboards on Superdash.
It's like generate AI dashboards on Superdash.
Like, you can work with an eraser and just like, kind of like, make it super scannable
for people.
So that as they're kind of like going in the sea of scroll on whatever Twitter is,
they'll be able to kind of like stand out.
And then this slide also cannot, all you need to do is connect your dashboard.
And then you'll be able to visualize your charts, get insights and track metrics.
But even then, this is still like, all right.
And this is Spine of the Week.
The best DM that I got from you guys was from Ryan.
Ryan, you want to talk about this?
Yeah.
Yeah, this is actually the day that you guys did the last BMW.
And literally, I know someone said we shouldn't be off-pointing for virality,
but somehow in our group chat, Ron introduced these follower-based accounts,
where as these followers get added, or as you follow this account,
you are added to, let's say, the conga line around the earth, right?
But for this one specifically, it's called Stapville.
And what it is, is like, as you follow, now you're a statizen.
And the city pretty much expands, as with every follower.
So then a new house would pop up by the next video.
And what's interesting, too, is they took it a step further.
And on the story, they would say, would you guys like a Ferris wheel here?
right? And then it's like they would show like two different designs, do you want
this one or this one? And I just found it so sick because I mean normally these
accounts are like you're just a person in the conga line and that's it, but
there's so much more engagement here. And so what was interesting too is that
there were accounts that were popping up like the Statville supermarket and they
literally were posting every day, here's like the bananas that are on sale and
people were literally engaging with those really niche accounts.
And I was just like, this is so cool.
It was made on a blender.
They have voting on their lives about what to do next.
They have these kind of like...
Can I call you those?
Good morning, Stetteville, the city that grows with each new follower.
Welcome to another monthly update.
Over the past month, our city has grown by nearly 80,000 Statizans.
A warm welcome to all of you.
As decided by our own community, a ski resort has been open to the northeast of the city.
With a considerable variety of trails, a terrain park, good restaurants, and of course, hot chocolate.
It's the perfect destination for a holiday retreat.
See you on the slopes, and be sure to share your suggestions for our city's future developments in the comments.
Dad, are you looking for another city update?
Yeah, wait, did you just call me Dan?
Yeah.
I don't know.
No.
It's beautiful.
Anyway, yeah, as always, we can find anything cool.
I'm in our way.
I'm also on top of our class.
You know where to find us.
And yeah, that's basically it.
Cool.
Cool.
Thank you, guys.
Nice.
