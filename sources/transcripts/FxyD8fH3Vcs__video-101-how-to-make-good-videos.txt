Welcome to video or DMW class 4, Videos 101. Just to give you guys a little bit of context, you guys know who I am, but you guys probably don't know what my experience is.
I started doing videos when I was a kid, started shooting like YouTube videos, saw my sister was doing YouTube videos and I thought like hmm, maybe I can do something better.
So I grabbed a camera, started making videos, and that was around like eight or nine.
And then moving forward, just started shooting like music videos, weddings, corporate videos,
small little client stuff, and yeah.
And then I ended up here.
So, yeah.
So, what makes a good video?
It's an open discussion.
I think it's many things like story as well as like cinematography.
I don't know.
Like it doesn't come up with like one single thing but I guess story maybe is the main
one.
Yeah.
Curiosity gap.
I guess it also depends on like what are you intending to create.
Okay.
One more.
I think just engaging.
The engaging?
Yep.
How engaging is it?
Yeah, there's a lot of things that make up a good video.
All your guys' answers is correct.
But these are like my four basic like fundamentals
of just like what is a good video.
It's one, storytelling and basic techniques
that we'll cover later.
The types of storytelling that you can do
when we talk about like Instagram, TikTok,
if you're posting it on YouTube or posting it on a blog site, whatever.
And then there's the workflow, right?
The building blocks of, like, okay, like, what's the process like?
You know, how do you get to, like, how do you get an idea on a video format, right?
So, yeah, that's all the things that we'll just talk about today.
When you're starting out, it should just be a feeling.
Like, I know we talk about, like, good hooks.
We can talk about all these things about what makes a good video, but in the beginning it should just be a feeling.
Like when I was first making videos when I was a kid, I was just making like a...
There was this thing called Hypercam, where it's like you record your gameplay,
and I was playing like Counter-Strike Source, and I would just like record that and slap like a good music behind it.
And to me, it was like I wasn't really caring about like what the intro or what the ending is.
I just wanted to make a video that felt good to me and so I made it.
Um, so yeah. Like, some of you are not in like, uh, the like, too deep into like the video making
side. You guys just want to make videos and tell about your product and show what you're doing.
Um, so if you're not used to like making like very intricate details on like a good video or whatever,
just make it feel good for you, right?
So videos, they make us laugh, cry, motivate,
makes us do actions, right?
When you guys are like watching a movie,
after you guys watch a movie,
you guys feel some type of way, right?
What are some feelings that you guys get
when you guys watch a video or a movie?
Maybe like the last thing you guys watched.
What were you watching?
I think it was actually watching
like actually watching
so it's not so laughing
cool cool okay
I haven't watched that yet
I gotta watch it
yeah
anybody else?
hype?
hype?
what was that
what video made you hype?
I was watching
um
go over to triangle time
okay cool
interesting
yeah yeah
So even from pictures, like they all make us feel some type of way,
make us want to do something or make us feel something.
So yeah, when you're thinking about making a video, your first video,
or like you want to continue like a ongoing process of like what you're trying to show,
most importantly, you should, it should be something that you would want to watch first.
it's pretty basic to know that but like I feel like right now we're like what there's like 46
45 days left and I can feel like people are like scramming to like get put content out there and
make sure like there's it's got everything right but like I think a lot of times like people are
missing like the basic basic like feeling that like okay is this a video
that you actually would want to watch like are you making this just to post it
like just to show people with the world like what you're doing or you know like
or is it something else right so because very basic if you don't like it then
others won't either yeah and another thing is just don't focus on chasing
numbers right now just focus just focus on chasing something that you will
actually like watching so yeah and the point I'm trying to make is good videos
and just about good hooks content and a CTA it's about a feeling so there's two
types of videos that you guys could probably make today and that you guys
probably see all the time right to me I'm calling these timeless and memes
Oh shit my bad just to give a little content I'm gonna show a video from Casey Neistat
This is like a timeless video from like the past that I always go back to watch
That I'm like what I'm like super lost and I'm like trying to make like a banger video for myself
I'm like fuck. I don't know where to you know where to start. I watch this video all the time
Just cuz it gives me a good framework to make a good video
We'll just watch a little bit of it.
from 10 miles
Yeah, we won't watch to if you want to watch the rest it's a very good video like is
It's just got storytelling all over it and not only that it's just like it's just a feeling and it conveys it so much through just like
These like not so produced like stuff probably shot on like a small little camera
but so this video was posted 12 years ago and
I've put a screenshot of this comment. I was posted a year ago
Saying this never gets old for the last 10 years. I keep re-watching every now and every now and every now
and every now and again every now and then right so that's like an example of
like a timeless video that some people make and I want to show you another
example of like a timeless video right now that people are making that hasn't
been around for a long time but like you can just tell like it's gonna be is
people are gonna find it in like yo like this is some gems this is Natalie
I'm sorry, darling.

right so I posted another comment on this one or screenshot it so now can you
guys read that I'll just read it out so Natalie I'm so late to your story I've
just come across you yesterday on Thanksgiving but I'll say I'm thankful I
did I watched every video on your channel oldest to newest and I'm glad I
did felt like I was on this journey through life with you living through
your eyes your travels and experiences it's pretty it's pretty obvious that you
know like what this video like meant to this person and what this video is gonna
mean for the next person that finds it so when we talk about like memes you
know sometimes it's not like it just means are just like for things that are
a generational time period like like I'll just show you the next slide I'll
I'll just show you the next one.
How many of you guys seen this video?
Who's that?
Okay, cool.
How many of you guys seen this, uh...
How many of you guys seen this, like, how many, uh, this template, this real?
Okay, cool, cool, cool, cool.
And how many of you guys actually tried to go do that?
I know you guys did.
I'll show you another one.
How many of you guys remember this one?
All right, cool.
Yeah, so let me just ask, so what made any of those two good to you guys?
Everyone's good.
Oh, shit.
What was it?
It's like a current trend.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, it's a current trend, so it's nice
to see it in different forms.
Right, right, what about you?
Yeah, everyone was doing it, so it was kind of,
there was this urgency to participate.
Right.
And people who executed it well, it was like, great.
Right, right.
It was just familiar enough, but not too unfamiliar.
When something is completely new,
I just think there's more things to understand.
Right. Do you guys think that it's... Oh, go ahead.
I was going to say something similar.
I was going to say it's a template that you see,
so you're willing to watch more.
You kind of know what you're going to get.
But, for example, you just kind of know what you're going to get
when you see that kind of video.
So you're willing to watch more.
Right, right, right.
Only when you've seen a few...
Yeah. Let me ask you guys.
Do you guys think there's like a...
Do you think memes are bad?
Or like do you think there's like a right or wrong like a video to do for you for for whatever context?
No, yeah, so I think you know they both serve a purpose. They're both trying to tell you something right?
Like memes are a very good way to just
Just get it out the way in a very humorous or
Sometimes a serious way right
Um, the point is like you should try to hyper focus on what you're trying to say and figure out what type of style it fits.
Like for my lane example, um, this is gonna play.
Fuck, I'm so sorry.
It's like you see how like she's going
She has like a
This curation going on right? I'm going down to the bottom
and right now it's like all over the place. This is what she was like she barely had like
1200 followers or I think 800 followers
She's just doing everything right it was until like
You know what like let me just try something that I like doing which is dear dear strangers something that she meant
It meant a lot more to her
and it's just like okay like I tried that out cool what's another thing okay she started
she started doing like whatever here and then she started doing like some template videos from other
people's like stuff and then after a while she just started figuring out like okay like she
started figuring out her style more and you can see that more obvious as you go as you scroll up
to like the present time right um you should experiment with both types of content because
you don't really know like sometimes you don't know what type of style fits like the message
you're trying to convey like if you're trying to like launch a video a lot of people like see our
videos and they're like oh build space made a skit for their launch video i gotta go make a skit for
for my launch video.
But it's like, why do you need a skit
for your launch video?
You're making, you're like, all right, we good?
Start from like that.
Oh yeah, I got you.
From where?
Like after, right after.
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.
All right, you guys back?
Cool.
Watch this run out.
But, yeah, are you guys, any of you guys, like, confused?
Like, if you guys have any questions, just, like, spit it out.
Because I can ramble sometimes, so.
And if nothing is, if everything is confusing to you, just let me know.
I'll try to clarify it.
But, where were we?
Yeah, maybe, maybe, yeah, yeah, yeah.
So, I was still like an artist.
I read a little bit about this book, but, honestly, from the cover,
I I learned a lot more from the cover that I did in the book
Yeah
So yeah, how many of you have seen this video?
Cool
Not a lot of people were surprised but like some people were surprised that I when I told them this I'm like
I actually stole the fucking script from this video from another person like I was scrolling for for hours
We were at a stage where we were like, okay, we gotta post some stuff.
Like, our follower count is, like, dying right now.
Like, we're not posting nothing.
So I'm at this point where I'm like, fuck, like, I'm out of ideas.
So, you know, what can I post?
So, you know, I looked to the internet for answers.
Instagram, specifically.
And I found this video.
And he's my boss.
And he's about to save our company.
Two years ago, Luke and Marcus took a massive risk to start off the X5.
Yeah, so I saw this video and I really liked the hook and I just really liked, not only
that, it wasn't really the hook, it was more like, okay, this company is also like a startup.
This company is giving kind of like our vibes and this is like a simple video for me to
like go and tackle.
So I was like, okay, fuck it.
I'm just going to like take every like context that he has and try to like mimic it.
Because, like, at the end of the day, you try to copy someone else, but, like, at the end of the day, you're just going to end up being you, right?
So that's what I did.
Yeah, I said this earlier, but try not to be, try not to make some, like, original fucking video, original video.
My bad, I'm cursing too much.
Try not to make an original video.
Many people have already paved the way for you to make good videos.
You just got to go out and find it.
You can think of these other videos just as templates, right?
Even in IG or like TikTok, the native editing platform that they got,
like you can actually see like the templates that you can use.
Like you go on TikTok and like how many of you guys see those like,
it's like a cat with a green screen or like some dude from a movie in a green screen.
Like use those, for example.
or like you can like just take a video that you like and just just mimic that
right I'm gonna show an example that Kat did
Cool video, right?

Okay. Got your hand raised?
Maybe some captions on the front end.
Like, for the audio on the first part.
So that I know what I'm hearing.
Yeah, yeah. I think for me that was like the biggest thing too,
is like just like the audio, right?
We'll go into that like later on.
But we were jamming, me and Kat, and like...
I might get the story mixed up, but like you you you needed like a
let's just
Make it simple like you needed some inspiration, right? So I asked cows like okay cat like
Like what type of videos you like watching?
Like is there someone that you like watching right now that you want to like aspire to make videos if you were to make videos
And she told me like care Carol crafts is it yeah, so care crafts is another like social media
influencer I guess or artists
So she took it from this video.
Super similar, right? But it's like, at the end of the day, Kat's video is just Kat.
This is definitely her.
I can't know who I'm using.
I can't know who I'm using.
Um, things in like Kat's like video that we'll talk more about is like her simple choices
of words, right?
Like, just like what Jeffrey was talking about like in copywriting.
You want to make your words like third grade level.
Like you don't want to be fucking explaining like what the theory of like relativity is
and like jargon.
Like you're trying to just tell me how it would be if ChatGBT told me, right?
Nice pacing with music, and she added her own style to it.
This framework isn't going to work for everybody, but...
It's not going to work all the time.
It's not going to work for everybody.
But if you just keep iterating on your voice and your style, eventually you'll find something.
How good did that video, or how did that video do, actually?
70?
70?
Okay, cool.
Cool, cool.
Did you end up making another one similar to that?
Yeah.
I was just following the slide and just watching that.
All right, well, cool, cool.
Yeah, so some practical frameworks that everyone can use.
One simple hack that everybody overlooks when they show me their videos is just choosing the right music.
Yeah, I'm gonna show you an example.
How many of you guys seen Open Armor?
Great movie, right?
But the soundtrack is crazy good.
I came out of it, I'm like, dude, I don't want to go buy a synthesizer and just start making music.
But one thing that stuck out to me is as soon as I came out of that movie,
I'm thinking of all the types of videos I can make with certain soundtracks,
certain parts of the scene, right?
But I look at scenes and I'm like, yo, I can use the same song and put it on a video
where I'm making mac and cheese.
You know what I mean?
Choosing the right music just helps you guide the type of video that you're trying to do.
Just an example.
This guy's just going to the movies.
So yeah, like, there's a lot of, I mean, like, having a good music catalog will help along
way um but also just like understanding like the like how the instruments like make you feel
you can like utilize that to like make others feel a certain way too like with open eyebird
like everybody like everybody knows this trendy like audio real sound right it's going by it went
viral on like ig tick tock everyone's like using it right i use it for like when i was like putting
gas in my in my car and i was like oh i see the numbers like changing hello i'm like this is
giving me Oppenheimer vibes so I like put I like recorded that and I just slapped the
open on Oppenheimer music it didn't really do well but it like I wanted to
just like convey the message like I'm spending hella gas like like you know I
mean so um and the other thing too is like like a lot of times like for us at
Billspace we like a lot of ideas start from just like word of mouth like a lot
A lot of our ideas are also just from like music.
Like we can hear something and we're like,
we're working backwards from that.
Like Barza might be like, oh shit,
like Linkin Park, breaking habits,
like we should do a video to this.
And we start working backwards to that.
One example we did is our own video of,
that we did with Openheimer.
How many of you guys seen this?
So you know like towards the end,
we used Openheimer, right?
Yeah, it's kind of a long video,
so I won't show it too much.
Oh, Devon.
Yeah
It's such a classic.
But yeah, just to give you a framework about that video, the process.
Oppenheimer was just coming out, or just came out, and we were trying to come up with a video.
We watched Oppenheimer four times.
Stop was like, let's go watch it another time.
You know what I mean?
So Oppenheimer's just in our head.
and we're like, okay, let's just make a video on like using this song.
And it's like trending, right?
But like don't just chase trends.
But like, yeah.
But in my head, I was like, I had the idea of just like,
okay, what if we're like, Jeffrey's just scrolling through a bunch of shit
and like that's the part where we're like play the open armor music.
So like we worked backwards around, we worked around that.
It was like, okay, what's the front of that?
And then what's the end of that, right?
So yeah, like choosing choosing the right music will just like help guide you
Make a video so does that does that make sense to you guys cool? So guys any questions?
What's up?
How do you find good music
You have to like always do it there.
You're always looking for it.
But do you listen to music?
How do you listen to music?
Spotify.
Spotify.
Yeah, I guess like, so you like rap.
You like 90s rap?
Yeah.
Yeah, so like, if you want to like make a video like do well,
just choose like a very famous familiar like 90s rap music like Biggie Smalls
uh Juicy right like everybody knows Juicy the amount of movies that that have used that song
and like Into the Spider-Verse uh other movies right when you hear that song you're like it just
clicks with you you're like oh shit like I know this song yeah you know so it's the same thing
when you're like making reels like you just want to give that same person like
that same effect yeah to answer your question
I'm not going to do it.
Um...
Alright, I see what it is.
Put the camera on in.
When...
When you're doing it, like if you go and have
a good taste in music,
when you're doing it,
if the video is about to do too slow,
if the video is like,
more like very um like fast pace you choose like more like hip hop and like because the beats are
very like right yeah so you choose the music on the style of the videos that you're creating
either you know it like your fast pace or slow pace like you have to do that so like what he's
telling us he chooses the music first now when you're choosing the visual first then you have
Yeah, I'll give you an example.
I'll give you an example.
If you didn't catch it the first time.
Nah, I got you.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Wait for this video to restart.
You hear that?
Like the beats?
Like I've been breaking down for like fucking 12 years like I just know like rhythm like that
But if you don't know rhythm like that then you should just like listen to music like carefully
Like so I know some people just listen to music just without like
Like like actually like being like musically inclined like that so I get it I get it
But like it's good to have that when you can like know the beats
Sometimes like texts just pop up on like certain videos right
It's just simple as that like
This video actually like, before I even like, I took the idea in my head from the other video.
I was like, okay, what's a good song to use?
Okay, I want something catchy in the beginning.
I know this, I know the perfect song, Mr. Blue Skies.
Because it has like a dun dun dun dun dun.
And it's also like, it's also just like a trending music that's been used multiple times on IG.
Look out to where I'm Harvey's head.
yeah
but yeah i also put having good music taste goes a long way so
if you want music bro i got a whole catalog on my spotify i got you anybody else have a
what's up so what i usually do i'll always like to go to the featured audios and then just choose
one of the ones that had like fewer reels made on it but what you're saying is like you should just
choose popular songs that people know anyways and not look at the trending audios that Instagift
or that they suggest?
No, I mean, like I said in the very beginning, how many videos have you made?
I'm not trying to test you out, but how many videos have you made?
Two and one.
Like, I've written about posted once a day since started.
Right, but like, okay, let me ask a different question.
Or let me just say something else.
In the beginning, just choose music that you like.
But if you just get stuck and you're like, I can't do this by myself,
then just go find the templates out there.
That's a perfect example.
Go into the IG.
They have a feature list of all the good songs that you can use.
You can see the number of reels that were made by it.
But like I said, you shouldn't just chase the numbers.
just tastes like what you think is good at the end of the day for you, right?
That's what I'm asking, because I was just doing that because it was just the easier
way to do it.
So what I'm asking, because I thought that's what would be most effective.
What I'm asking is like, even if you take other songs besides the trending audios,
does that also help it go viral, I guess?
If you choose a trending audio sound?
I mean, so what I'm trying to ask is like, what you're saying that the music helps a lot with the storytelling, right?
So I get that, but what I'm asking is that by choosing music that helps with the storytelling,
does it also, is it also music that helps to go wider?
Yeah, why not? Fuck it.
Yeah, like, but it has to fit your video though.
Yeah.
Yeah, like if you're making like if you're trying to make a video about
nurses giving like helping give birth like you wouldn't use like a
trendy Biggie Smalls song right?
Like you would use something trendy if you want to make it go viral you would find something that fits that song
But is also viral but like use it in that nature does that make sense?
Yeah, if you want it, viral music does help along the way.
That's what your answer is, I mean, what you're looking for.
Um, damn, where was I?
Okay, basic fours.
So basic fours for every video, just how I think.
Color grade, sound effects, vocals, and music.
Um, we'll go into that.
So for many of you, these elements don't really matter as much because you guys are probably
shooting on an iPhone, probably don't have Premiere, probably using CapCut, that's it,
or maybe just IG native editing platforms.
But it's a good skill to know.
One example is just like, Brandon asked him, like, how do you find good music?
That should be a simple answer, right?
Like how you find good music, right?
But for a lot of you guys, it's probably not.
So I'm going to just give an example of having a restaurant.
Popeyes.
Who here likes Popeyes?
Love Popeyes.
You got this amazing recipe for chicken.
So you make a restaurant.
But you feel like something's missing, right?
This is your restaurant right now.
It's kind of flat, kind of dull.
The lights, you got lights, but it's not really like lights, lights.
You know what I mean?
You got tables and everything, you know, you got some colors, but it's feeling a little flat.
Fuck it, let's add some license and more color, right?
So damn.
Now everything is like, oh, damn, like, now I want to go to this Popeye's, you know?
Oh, so you got people lining up for your recipe for your chicken, you know?
So, really, it's just like setting the vibe.
When you have like a, when you really want to go more in depth with it, with like videos,
like if you really want to make a video stand out you want to like go back to
these basic fours just having like maybe like a slight color grade sound effects
all that like for example like Sami came to me about like wanting it like a you
felt like your video was flat on your on your reel right you wanted to add more
like you said how do you make it how do you make it cinematic you know I mean
so just mess around with the colors and like there's so many different tutorials on youtube
you can use to like make a video feel like it's a winter moody feel you know or like a summer feel
or like how do i make like uh like i want to i want to show my product at this at this second
but like it feels flat like i want to go like this but it just doesn't feel right well maybe
Maybe if you add a whoosh or a hit effect, then it's more dynamic, you know?
And then your vocals, for Cat's example, you can barely hear it, right?
Even if you put it up to 200%, you can still barely hear it, right?
So just really, like, remembering those little small details really matters.
But the video did pretty well, so yeah.
And then just music, right?
I put music separate and like gave it a little bit more in depth because music really helps
a lot.
Like it truly helps a lot.
Like I think like a lot of our videos are influenced just by like music.
So yeah.
So the more aware of the feelings your videos convey, then you'll find a style that suits
you.
But like I said, I wouldn't focus too much on these like things if like you're just trying
to like if you're just early on just trying to make videos it's just like an
auxiliary part of your like your creation spend most of your time just
storytelling ideating and then having like a good workflow to like back all
your stuff up right so how many guys have a workflow when you guys make videos
what's your workflow bro
What's your workflow when this comes to video stuff?
Take us from point A to point Z.
Mine is more like, I basically have the footage and I place it according to the story that
I want and then probably add music.
Then I listen to all types of music and then I edit it in terms of music.
So I choose the music after my shots are aligned on the timeline.
And before this, I get the idea of what the message is from the video.
So I have to get that far.
Cool.
That's more or less the way.
So, do you have one?
Did you have your answer?
What was it?
Yeah.
So, I mean, I record the videos, whatever I have.
after that I put it in my software and chronologically I just like order it that
this comes first this comes first and I eliminate all the videos that I don't
like and don't want in my video then I usually have a music in mind like you so
I just put that music and I start editing after I have like a basic edit I
start doing like sound effect stuff and then I just keep tweaking it until it
feels like. Cool cool. Dope. Yeah so I mean same for me I just like my process is
I just scavenge for hours scrolling on Instagram and I I have like a my dog has
a Instagram account and I was thinking like how the hell am I gonna store all
these videos out like so I just sent them all in my dog's Instagram account
and it works it works out I also even put like a I mean like a discord channel
for myself because sometimes like I don't want to spam these guys like I don't
want to spam more like work team discord you know cuz sometimes you guys just
do out you just gotta be professional right so I put all I just put all my
stuff like all my unhit stuff to my like channel my discord but the Instagram
account for my dog is like probably the most looked at like catalog that I see
And sometimes Jeffrey would send over like trending audio sounds, right?
Just like this video that we're working on with Bonnie.
It started off as an audio sound.
Yeah, so like...
You mentioned about like just going through like reels, right?
Next step I would do is just like, okay, like we got this song.
Let's look at other people, like let's see what they did with this song.
song. And you'll notice a lot of the stuff under the song that you see is kind of a similar
vibe. And we just try to follow that same vibe, just make it different, right? And then
the next step is just like, okay, we got our song, we know what type of vibe we're trying
to go for, let's make the script. And we try to keep it super basic. We're not trying to
write like whole essays here right guys so I know there's gonna be narration so
just me talking and I write it in this way cuz it's just simple for me to like
know the beats so like for example so we have all these used boxes from Amazon
it's like there's that pause because you don't want to be like so we have all
these used boxes from Amazon and we'd like to restart like you know I mean like
you kind of want to have like a good pace you want to give yourself good
pacing so that way um that way when you plug all these videos in after you shoot them it's just
gonna like fit in naturally right um i'm also mindful what i'm writing because i don't want to
write bonnie's in alaska making cardboard boxes how the hell am i gonna put bonnie in alaska
simple as that right so i just kind of keep like what we have here and what i can shoot like right
way um yeah it just helps like that workflow just helps kind of put like all the footage
into the script as easy as possible and then you have like minor iterations here and there
um and this is just like how it looks how it looked as a first draft i try to cook up like
a first draft right away just so i can like show it off to the team and like maybe get a vibe from
somebody else right yeah then I get a feedback this is my little text with the
group I'm it there yeah what the fuck yeah I'm bad at this myself I try not to
think too much about it um some of you guys asked me like hey like some of you
would ask me like what should I do differently for this video and I'm
thinking like it's a ready banger video like you know you don't have to do too
much to it and also like you gotta think about like the effort you're gonna take
to like make changes to your video and I mean like is it really worth it like is
it really good is this video really gonna move a needle for you like can you
just like simply post it and just show people that you're building something or
like you're showing something and then work on the next thing you know so that's
what I mean by like not thinking too much about it just shoot go make
something for yourself and yeah that's all for today
you guys have any questions
