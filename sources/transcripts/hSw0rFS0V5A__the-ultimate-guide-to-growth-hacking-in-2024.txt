All right, so welcome to DMW class 007, or 007.
I think today we'll talk about getting the word out.
And most of it's essentially just going to be about growth hacking.
I think a lot of you are past zero at this stage,
and I just want to give you some frameworks
so you can start thinking about how you can take it 10x
and how you can kind of like incorporate
all these different strategies we may talk about today
into getting more users or more followers, listeners, et cetera.
Cool. Again, it's a pretty long one.
So I'm going to speed run a lot of it,
but feel free to stop me at any time.
I don't think we'll have time to do a review towards the end,
but I'll take questions.
Cool. All right.
But first, what's the importance of this number?
Is that under the data?
Oh, they're called data, right?
Yeah.
We're 24 days.
How many hours?
Kobe Brown.
Oh, yeah.
But also, it's how many days you have left.
You have 24 days left.
How are you feeling?
OK.
Yeah?
Out of 10?
Seven.
10.
24.
24.
24.
Who's feeling confident AF?
Bronson, as always.
Brayden, another as always.
Cool. How's the rest of them? How are you guys feeling? Anyone want to speak up? Samaya?
Yeah, what do you want me to say?
How are you feeling? How are you feeling with 24 days left?
I feel like I went through a lot in the past two months and I understood a lot of things.
I understood a lot of what I don't need to do and what I don't have to do, but I'm still figuring out exactly what I should be doing more of.
So I'm...
I... but I feel satisfied that I explored so much.
Right?
Yeah.
Same book. I think like...
I learned like the shit time here.
And despite not necessarily me feeling on track for my goal,
it does a discount for the fact that I did a lot
that I wouldn't have normally done alone.
So I guess feeling conflicted that not necessarily
meeting goal, but also acknowledging the work I've done.
Cool.
Yeah.
Yeah, a lot of this is like riding the bike, right?
Like right now you have the training wheels on.
24 days they'll come off.
Whether you want them to come off or not, that's okay.
A lot of this is that process, the process of discovery.
Cool.
But yeah, most of you here, what I've observed are too smart for your own good.
Right?
So we talked about this a little bit before.
Baby is not bold.
So I just want to hope that we'll take the next hour to just simplify some things.
I'll demystify using some examples, maybe taking your questions, and then we can just
kind of go from there.
But ultimately, yeah, I want you to get out of your head and get the word out.
That's basically my goal from this talk.
So what is growth hacking?
Anyone want to tell me?
Does anyone know growth hacking, has done growth hacking?
Michael?
It's just like methods to grow your product.
So it's like a broad, like SEO is a big part of it.
So it's more like the non-traditional
kind of .
Yeah.
Go ahead.
I have an essay to do tomorrow, but I don't know.
Yeah.
Well, we'll cover that example specifically.
But essentially, at the end of the day, in the simplest terms,
it's just marketing experiments to acquire new users
retain existing users that you have.
So it's essentially whatever it takes.
A lot of that may include things that
are pretty non-traditional.
But yeah, you can also do things that are traditional.
Just doing a lot of them, just thinking of them
as experiments where you have hypotheses,
and how quickly can you prove or disprove that hypothesis.
Make sense?
Cool.
Yeah, can be literally anything, right?
So viral videos, marketing stunts, leveraging other people,
A-B testing, anyone I think you mentioned, creating a site.
I have a marketing SIDU at midnight.
Anyone has any other growth hacks that they've either tried
or heard about in the past?
I mean, just in terms of onboarding,
like coming in with a different approach,
Like, if you design the experience of something that is traditionally friction to be entertaining and engaging,
then it turns something that is a chore into a game, you know, something that people traditionally don't want to participate in
into something that they do want to participate in and they want more of,
then I mean a byproduct of that is going to be growth
because your conversions are going to just increase.
Yeah, so gamification is a big part of it for sure.
Yeah, but it's also like you may see people
kind of like going on different podcasts, right?
So that's just a growth hack.
You're leveraging other people's audience
to kind of get the word out for yourself, right?
A lot of you have, Josh has made videos for you guys, right?
That's also like a growth hack in many ways, right?
Where you're leveraging BuildSpace's audience to bring and funnel some people into it.
Media, like news media.
So I'll say there's like an example, but it basically can get this one video.
I think it's like Nathan for you, where he does it, where he goes around as like a marketing set
I think this is a pro-yo to make a food flavor
from every PNB attention or something.
Yeah.
But like, that's a nice example,
but you can do stuff like that.
You remember the guys when Elon was laying
all the Twitter employees and two people?
That's a growth hack too, right?
They're trying to grow their personal brand.
That guy's actually upstairs a lot of the days.
One of them, Rahul.
Rahul?
Rewarding the users and giving them money
to use the application.
Yep.
I know that's the one and a half years ago,
giving $100 for like nice stuff about like,
saving if you can .
Do you have a lot of this ?
Yeah.
Yeah, so it can be anything, right?
And we'll cover a lot of them today.
But yeah, you have to figure out which ones might work best
for you and just quickly run the experiment.
Just remember, no matter what experiment you run,
the goal is to get to a decision in the past.
But again, think of who?
Everyone I'm guessing took chemistry
at some point in their lives.
So it's so much similar to just an experiment, right?
You have a hypothesis, quickly carry out the experiment,
and get to the results, proving or disproving.
Hypothesis.
So the decision in this case is whether to double down
on the experiment or kill it.
That's basically it.
Don't overcomplicate it.
Yeah, I do not want to see any one of you.
You have 24 days left, but none of you should be spending 42 weeks working on the perfect
marketing plan.
That may have worked in the past.
It does not work now.
It may work for large organizations.
It definitely will not work for you.
One, you can't afford that time.
And a lot of you guys are playing the game single player right now.
So time is obviously you're breaking it down.
Who's familiar with codingweekmarketingweek.com?
What is it?
Tell the class, Edgar.
I think if you're on the state, it's a website
where you go on the website and just every week,
based on the week, you just tell you this week is marketing
or this week is .
GARY GENSLERY, Yeah, so it's coding week, right?
And it's literally just flip-flops
between coding week and marketing week
to help people make better decisions about what the hell
they're trying to do.
Who here has just worked for a long time on a project,
some product, and just kept coding new features into it
and never actually getting it out?
Or same thing with a song, right?
So it applies to anything and everything you're doing.
Make sure to be hyper-cognizant that, hey,
it's just as important to get the word out
as important as to build the thing that you're trying to build.
So make the most of your time and be crafty.
So at the end of the day, it's like whatever it takes mentality.
Call back to, again, the early slide of Kobe Bryant,
where basically I'll do whatever it takes to win games,
whether it's sitting on a bench, laying a towel,
handing a cup of water to a teammate,
or hitting the game-winning shot.
So for you, that's like, if it's marketing week or marketing day, whatever it takes that you feel is the thing that needs for your product or app or music or whatever to succeed.
Whether it's outreach emails, calling people, going door to door, hitting up influencers, whatever it takes.
You're just trying that really, really quickly and seeing the path to a decision, right?
Whether you want to double down on what it is you're doing or killing it.
Make sense?
All right.
All right, let's cover some basics.
AARRR, who knows this?
Anyone?
There's some kind of product
that are that show, acquisition,
or I don't know what else, retention.
Yeah, so basically acquisition,
activation, retention, referral, and revenue.
You may have seen this before, right?
covered literally like an entire class in marketing can be done on just this funnel.
And I think you'll have the deck after so you can go and actually look at the
the growth manifesto where I pulled this from but let's simplify it right. Acquisition how
the hell are people finding you right. So for a lot of you guys for music at Spotify, SoundCloud,
YouTube for software people it may be Twitter X SEO ads hack and use reddit
product haunt etc for a lot of the content creators here maybe just getting
the content seen on a TikTok Instagram YouTube shorts YouTube etc make sense so
that's the first part second part is activation
If a marketing professor saw this, they're gonna be like, what the fuck is going on here?
Activation. How long before they go, oh shit, right?
So basically, it's like, oh shit, I need this product. Oh shit, what a banger song.
Oh shit, what a video.
That's basically the activation point.
Cool?
Retention is like, are people coming back?
So in the case of Sumaya, they may have heard one song like, fuck, another hit?
right so it's like they're like that's like oh they're excited that something
else is also happening bill space dropped a new vid or your favorite food
truck has now been added it's all these things can be in any fashion it can be an
email can be a notification maybe they're subscribed to you maybe a text
message or are people coming back whether it's like through push or pull
I haven't covered push and pull I think we'll do a whole class on that but
Essentially, anyone familiar with Push vs. Pull?
I actually just learned about this something
that was working on with James, but let's see if I can remember.
So Push is where, I guess, you are distributing to a consumer.
But Pull is where you're here and the consumer
is searching for you.
Yeah.
And yeah.
So basically it's like, a lot of times it's like in built-in habits, right?
Like maybe every day from 9 to 10, you'd like to go on like TikTok or Instagram, right?
And you're just like pulling information.
It's not being pushed to you.
It's just like you're happy you're doing that.
Now, push could be you get a new email from Farza, right?
or you see something that essentially gets you back to the app.
And all of that can be part of the push.
So, like, any kind of notifications, any kind of viral stunt that you do
that gets you to use the product, that's a push.
But we'll cover more about that.
I don't want to confuse you guys right now.
But, so, yeah, retention, are people coming back?
Referral, are people telling others about it?
And that's also done in multiple ways.
But we'll cover a few word of mouth.
It's like, yo, I have a block.
I go to one of my friends and be like, bro, are you using?
Or you've got to check out this thing I'm using
to block distractions.
Or if an MCAT student was able, reaches out to another one
and be like, yo, you've got to check out this new tool
I've been using to study for the MCATs.
So that's kind of like, are they doing that?
Are they getting more people in?
For Luke, it's like, oh, I competed in this Rocket League last week, right?
It's like, yo, another competition happening this week, you should come check it out.
We see a lot of people already do that here, but it's like that's kind of the referral part of the funnel.
It could also be like sharing, you know, like Nia Teaser, one of the Buildspace videos.
I don't know if you guys can see that.
Oh, you can.
5,400 people shared her story, right?
So they're referring that video to other people.
you gotta check out this video.
Same thing happened to 1,400 people with Braden's video.
So no matter what platform you're using
to get your word out,
there's all these things that you can look at
to actually see what part of the funnel
is working well versus which ones can improve.
Cool?
All right, and finally revenue,
or people actually paying.
This isn't an asterisk because a lot of you people
may not care about this,
but essentially it's like listeners,
followers, subscribers, viewers, some kind of like
North Star metric that you're tracking.
I hope all of you guys are tracking a North Star metric.
Anyone here not tracking one?
All right, who's tracking what?
Rashid, what are you tracking?
Users?
Anyone else wanna tell us?
Omar?
Users.
Users?
tracking all of us right now, but I think now,
I've been working my game over this
to be 10 games this month, and after that, I'm working.
That's good.
OK.
James?
Hello, it's like subscribers and watch time.
OK, cool.
Remini?
Remini?
Yeah.
Yeah, so for some, like it's, this is a tricky one, right?
So some of you may have people paying day one, right?
Like, blocks is a good example, I think.
For you guys, too, right?
Like, looking at how much money you're getting from affiliates,
it's like a tangible number that you can track.
But for some, it's like, yeah, I'm just trying to grow my user base.
And then I'll decide what to do with it.
Nothing wrong with either strategy.
I think revenue for you, that's too, right?
But yeah, just think about this entire funnel deeply.
will force you into quick experiments that you need to run and it will actually also help you
clarify what problems you're solving that seems pretty rudimentary but for a lot of you that
problem you're solving is pretty obvious for some of you it may not be that obvious right now but
that's okay who's clear on what problem you're solving raise your hands if you don't raise your
I'm going to zoom, you're not clear.
All right.
All right, who's unclear?
Now raise your hand.
Kareem.
What about the fucking rest?
You're just vibing?
I'm clear?
Cool.
Yeah, like I said, it's completely OK.
Process of discovery by carefully learning and iterating
on the pain points, whatever the pain points you feel like you're
trying to devise solutions for.
And try your best to use your curl
hacks to articulate this problem better every single time
with every iteration.
And we'll, again, talk about a lot of this is philosophical.
So again, feel free to stop me at any time and ask questions.
But I'll try to cover all of it and then just open it up in the end.
So a very simple model that I've used in the past
to help me clarify this messaging is this model,
the time or money model.
Who remembers this from one of my previous talks?
Abel?
Anyone else?
Nish?
Gap.
I've heard of it.
OK.
Yeah, so I'll quickly cover it, right?
So it's like basically, let's say you're
trying to go to the Kanye concert from campus.
A lot of you guys did this this past week.
And you are like, all right, I got to take an Uber or a Lyft.
These are my two options.
One's $44.95.
The other one's $35.24.
Which one do you take?
Raise your hand if you take an Uber.
Most of you, just by this information,
there's obviously some missing pieces,
will opt for this, correct?
Why?
Right you just you're getting to the same destination. It doesn't matter. We're like it's not that uber has significantly better cars than
He's trying to get from point a to point B. I would save about $10 with lyft. I'll just use lyft
What how about this
All right, this is a telephone, right who takes uber
Raise your hands high.
What the fuck is going on?
I can't see them.
All right, let's say the concert starts at an hour, right?
All right, so Uber?
Uber fam is where?
Bronson.
OK, what about Lyft?
Who still takes the Lyft?
Who?
There's no right or wrong answer for this one, right?
Everyone's different.
But it's to illustrate that point that, OK,
Either you're trying to save time or either you're
trying to save money.
There's very rarely a third option for a lot of these products.
But did you say once a week, as an hour?
It's an hour.
What would you do after getting there in two minutes?
I'm just saying.
For some, it's like, yo, it could be like, oh, let's say
you're just trying to go to a friend's.
It's not about the drive.
So for some people, like, okay, better one is like,
I used to use a gas station model before.
Yeah.
That was the previous one.
The reason, because this happened to me
a couple of nights ago when I'm trying to take Uber
back from the airport back to my crib, right?
The Lyft was eight minutes away
and the Uber was one minute away,
but the price difference was fucking, I think 12 bucks.
So I'm like, okay.
I don't mind waiting eight minutes.
probably take me that long just to get outside and all those things I was like
okay cool I'll just go with the Lyft but it's like to me it didn't really like I
don't have affinity towards Lyft or uber at the point like now you can argue
that there could be ways to make that experience better from either of the
products so that that price difference is not what if they open the door for you
when you get there I was talking like drinks and shit once you're in the car
I'm like, OK, cool.
Maybe I'll go with the Uber app.
So it's like, at what point can you flip a person over?
And in their case, it could be just with time, right?
So yeah, help people save time, help people save money,
or both.
If you can do both, directly or indirectly.
So like for these guys, it's like, got an essay.
you at midnight, let AI write it in your voice.
It's like, OK, cool.
I'm saving so much time.
One, I don't even have that much time, so I'm going to use that.
And at that point, you have an hour
before your fucking exam or before the essay is due.
They're not really thinking, all right, where can I save $3?
It's like, I just go to get it done.
I haven't thought.
My most popular songs are the ones that
have a really small intro.
I feel like those songs help people save time
and they just get straight to the body of the track.
Yeah.
There's one-minute tracks, too, which I've blown up lately.
Are you familiar with them?
Yeah.
Just the entire song in a minute.
That's it.
Yeah.
I'm actually getting shorter.
Yeah.
It's a little bit more challenging when it comes
to entertainment slash content.
And I'll have a little disclaimer there.
But this model, it's crazy how well this works for such a large percentage of things.
Yeah, so another way that you'd be like, oh, if you can share JotBot with five friends,
you can get five months for free, right?
It's like all of a sudden, they're literally sending it to anyone and everyone
because they're getting, it's helping them save money.
So again, all of these things are fitting into the model that we talked about, right?
with retention, referrals, acquisition, things of that nature.
What else do we have?
Blog disables the most distracting apps for you with a tap.
It's like you're helping people save time.
Cool. Pretty straightforward.
This one's a cool one where
Claros find the best products to buy.
They review all the different Reddit boards and things of that nature.
Just finds you the best product.
You're saving time.
Hours you could be spending scrolling, looking for the best blankets or the best monitor.
Now you can just do it in seconds.
You're saving time.
I don't know if you guys have this yet, but like if you can quickly see who is selling it the cheapest, like Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy, and just pick the...
You can make it so that they can save money as well.
Are you guys doing that already?
Not yet.
Cool.
So it's like you're doing both.
You're helping people save time first,
but then you're directly helping them save money.
That's a cool fucking product.
It's like if you look at why people go to Walmart,
it's like, yo, there's going to be unbeatable prices.
It's going to be the cheapest thing around.
So that's why people are like, all right, cool.
I don't really care too much about where
I'm getting my dishwasher fluid.
I'm just going to go to the one that's the cheapest.
It may not be as intuitive for a lot of you here.
I know I'm glad you're already thinking about like, you know, like my shortest songs are
doing, but like it's not that intuitive, right?
Like your heart doesn't actually apply to me.
So I'm going to use like a pretty obscure example.
This guy.
Who's this guy?
James.
Who's that?
All right.
So what is James doing?
Is he helping save people time or money?
What do you think you're doing?
I'm educating people.
I know, but are you helping them save time or money?
Saving money.
Actually, I think more on money,
because the ideal student for me,
they have money and time to learn,
but they cannot afford to get a real proper coding course.
Cool.
So he helps make software development fast and fun.
How accurate is that?
Yeah, the idea of my is that I have a YouTube channel
that makes software development fast and fun.
Cool.
Yeah.
Daniel told me that, so.
It's my 100% .
But yeah, he does free videos on YouTube, right?
He has Making a Vision Pro app with ChatGPT, AI YouTube Timestamp Generator.
He live streams, like, mental health resource app.
So he does this, but at the end of the day, he's inspiring people to make software using code and or no code, right?
But how does this work?
So let's say he – do you have that?
I think you do, right?
Yeah.
So one hour, make an Airbnb clone with Bubble.
Again, it saves time.
within an hour I'm essentially getting from nothing to something with an actual app.
I'd say it also probably saves money because somebody's alternative might be to hire somebody to build it.
Hire somebody or buy another course on bubble development, right?
Let's save time.
But then now once they learn that, they can use that knowledge to build something of their own,
ideally making money from it indirectly.
So that's kind of like the direct and direct relationship
of how your thing is also helping people.
Saving time directly and directly,
or helping people save or make money directly or indirectly.
Maybe he inspires someone to start their own YouTube channel.
So it's like helping people make money directly at that point.
So it's like there's so many ways and nuances
of breaking this down.
Just using that as an example.
Yeah, with this, I'm just trying to say that it's not a one
size fits all model.
But I'm just saying that if you're
hella unclear on your problem, this
is one of the different tools that you
can use to get closer to whatever it is you're trying to do.
It may work for a lot of you.
It may not work for a lot of you.
Yeah, I always put the musicians here,
because that's always a big question.
Even last time with SF1, right?
It's like, how do you directly apply that when you're
trying to get people to feel and vibe with whatever content
you're putting out.
I have another one for that.
So yeah, before I go into that one,
I'm just trying to say that if you cannot figure out
the problem you're solving, just see how this model can
be used and applied.
I have to just jump to start your process on discovering
that problem you're solving.

Cool.
All right, so for you guys, another model
that can help you get closer to the problem you're solving
is that if, well, all of you guys are at some point
selling a transformation.
So just make whatever transformation you're selling
super obvious.
So what I mean by that is, let's say it's like someone's
feeling like this, right?
No one fucking understands how I'm feeling.
Great.
So that's why, like, even if you look at, like, Nia T's videos, right?
So much of her audience, it's like, that's the problem she's solving for them.
It's like they're finally feeling heard.
I think the example I've used here is Taylor Swift.
Because all of her songs, like, you know, like, when you talk to, like, a true Taylor Swift fan,
I think she's writing songs for me.
And they all feel like this, right?
And she's taking them on this journey.
Any questions about this?
Straightforward, right?
Cool.
Let's say you're selling a transformation of photos looking like trash.
This is the problem your user faces.
No matter what I do, my photos just look like trash.
And Samsung comes up with this banger.
108 megapixels.
that's crazy
more than a hundred
eight more than a hundred
who fucks with this
I haven't
is it why you bought it
no
why'd you buy it
it's the bestest family market
bestest family market
you like it too
what about it is compelling
that's just a lot of kids
it's mad
niche market
i don't fuck with this personally
it doesn't tell me at all of like is it actually going to help me take better pictures
right apple does it a little bit differently
like they just do these like like i'm sure you would have seen this just like take a walk on
chestnut and stuff right where like they just like yo bro i don't even know right i'm like
i don't even know if the new iphone is gonna make me take pictures like that but i'm like
fuck yeah i'm gonna buy it and this is like one of their most popular campaigns to shout on iphone
just by looking at it they're like people feel that they can take such pictures
now versus this, right?
Make sense?
Cool.
So yeah, be super straightforward
about these transformations.
You do not need to make it complex.
And everything you do, right,
whether it's your videos, your ads,
your landing pages, your bios, your stories,
they should all try to encapsulate
this transformation that you're selling to them
as simply as possible.
um i'm gonna run through one example that we did so like for us when we were doing like
we did nights and weekend season one we had a pretty large community on discord at that point
too it's like everyone's having conversations having fun there was a community a twitter
element to it as well but it's like you know how do you make people feel as if they're part
something larger that feels like home. So I kind of like look back right to my old school days
we had houses we had four houses it was a British schooling system
sapphire ruby emerald and topaz. Sapphire was fun as fuck right felt so magical dude especially we
had this one week where we had like a sports day a festival all these competitions among the houses
It's very similar to Harry Potter, but it just felt so good.
Right?
And, like, you legit were, like, banded by your house.
Like, even today, like, if someone's like,
I'm like, no, bro, I'm not fucking Ruby, bro.
Get the hell out of here, right?
I'm Sapphire.
But, so it's like, okay, cool.
What if we had houses to convey a similar emotion or belonging, right?
So this was, like, my quick, like, experiment.
Like, okay, what if you just did that?
So very quickly, right, I whip up four landing pages on Framer.
This is, when was this now?
Almost two years ago on the dot.
On the other side of the building, none of this existed.
Where we had just kind of like outlined the first season of Nights and Weekends.
And I was like, okay, cool.
We'll need something to tie it all together as this gets bigger.
But it's like, I just quickly made four landing pages.
uh with like sharif had showed me stable diffusion a week before took that just kind of created four
simple ones with different fonts right and i kind of like gather around for khan farza
some of the people that i think i'm like yo which one which one do you wipe with
right like which would which do you think you are and all of a sudden right like they're like all
they all start to like attack like i'm the yellow one bro they don't even know how to say it
uh i'm the blue one and all of a sudden i'm like okay cool the initial experiment was done
that decision made let's double down right so then over time i'm sure like i started like
leaving like breadcrumbs like even in like nights and weekends season two so if you go back to
was it last year february yeah no no even before that dude i think season two which is august of
20... fuck I don't know. Sometime in the past lads where we had even like the frames for the things
that you were editing to post out had like S001, A001. So like we had never told anyone about the
houses but we're just kind of like starting to see which ones people are picking and just seeing like
how Twitter will look and things of that nature way before we officially introduced the houses.
but then this was just last season we had we now have four sites for this and like you know
you have all people like really like us like you know who's part of which house like who's
specter see here okay who's uh alteroc godmars and airwolf so it's kind of like it's it's we're
still early right so it's like okay i'm still continuing to do a lot of experiments with this
a lot of this becomes a lot more fun when we have like a lot more people into this.
There's like long-term plans for each of the house sites too, it's like it's fine.
Let it all take its time to marinate properly.
Make sense?
Yeah, 100%.
But yeah, like all of these things now we've done, we have many things,
the people fucking carrying posters around the world as well.
So, yeah, a lot of this takes time,
but keep doubling down on small experiments
that you think will work.
Use the data that you're getting
and just kind of keep going.
Let's move on to Chronicles of Naveed from Unriddle.
Is Homie here?
Oh, he's probably in there.
Everyone knows Naveed?
Yes.
All right, SF1 student, building Unriddle.
way for people to kind of like
quickly come in and like
interact with their documents, write stuff
things of that nature
was part of SF1
started at 2K MRR
he started SF1 with 2K MRR
and
Homie did a
shit ton of growth experiments a few weeks in
where he started
to, I don't know, he started to
create like all these specific landing pages for all different archetypes of
people that were already part of his, that were using this product. So he had
like biologists, PhD researchers, students, some parents, he's right there by the way.
And things of that nature. He also kind of like scraped public researcher data
sets to get emails and then send them emails, a lot of outbound stuff. He
reached out to influencers, paid ads on Reddit, did paid ads on Reddit,
affiliate marketing. He launched, recorded demos in that room, launched them on X, paid
people to post in student discords, direct emails, anything and everything in the books
that he could have tried, he tried. I think at most, it'll be two or three days, right,
that you did all your experiments? Yeah, so. That's him, that's the meet from Unrundle,
that's camera, pan to him.
All right.
So, yeah, basically,
till he found one that worked for him,
which was reaching out to influencers.
So he did an experiment
where he got five influencers on TikTok
to make videos about Unriddle.
I think he paid them anywhere between $50 to $200 per video.
And I think it was one of the videos
that blew up to $600,000
and doubled his MRR from $2,000 to $4,000,
literally on a weekend.
Your journey is pretty similar too, right?
Do you want to share?
Sure.
Yeah, we made videos ourselves for a while.
And then that was how we got our initial users,
just from some 10,000 new videos.
And then one of the videos we made kind of blew up.
And then we just started spamming videos from ourselves
and got our friends to make videos.
and it's just like kind of kept going.
Are you doing influencers now?
Yeah, we're starting with influencers,
and we're kind of like in that experimental phase.
We're also like doing like paid ads.
We did a Reddit post, whatever.
Yeah.
Cool.
But yeah, so yeah, he got his decision
whether to continue the experiment or kill it.
So he doubled down.
And once he started to get traffic,
he met other optimizations I'm sure
where he's trying to make sure that the people,
now they're coming here are they converting to whatever it is he wants them to convert to
essentially paid user
so let's say you have a similar app like naveed right you help people research with ai
you essentially have a free tier to try and a ten dollar per month pro plan let's say that's
example we're going to use in this exercise right and these are your current stats you have 10 000
people visiting your site, you have a thousand people making an account with just 10% conversion,
you have 50 people that are going paid at the $10 per month plan, again, 5% conversion
from the thousand that have made an account, which ultimately results into you getting $500 per month.
Cool. So let's say you do your first experiment, which is like, you get a TikTok influencer and
You get, one of the videos blows up,
all of a sudden you have, can you read that?
Probably, yeah you can.
You have 50,000 people now coming to your site.
So if nothing else changes, right,
just that one top of the funnel experiment
has made you go from $500 MRR to $2,500 MRR.
Make sense?
What should this guy do next, or gal?
They can double down to it again.
What else can they do?
They can improve the conversion rates.
How?
They could create like landing pages that are designed
for TikTok or something.
So they're simpler, easier to sign up on social media.
Yep.
Any other ideas?
Can I make sure it moves?
Right for loops?
Yeah.
Cool.
All right, so let's do another one.
A-B testing, like Michael was saying, right?
It's like, OK, cool.
Let's make sure more people.
I'm not happy that only 10% of the fucking people
are making an account, right?
Can I double that to 20%?
So it's like, again, you're studying your data obsessively.
Right?
So it's like, OK, cool.
Now 50,000 people coming in, great.
10,000 of them are now making an account instead of five.
Right, so you doubled your conversion
on how many people are making an account
and if everything else remains the same,
that essentially takes you from 2,500.
Just with two experiments, you have 10 next.
I mean, again, these are hypothetical numbers, guys,
but I hope the bigger picture is clear.
Right?
Okay, now, cool, you have 20%,
which is pretty good for your conversion
on people making an account.
What can you do next?
More retention, more conversion.
Any other ideas?
Yeah, so let's do the third one, right?
Where, hey, let me just, maybe $10 a month
is too much for people to pay.
Let me add just one more price in here
to see how that would do, right?
in this case, you already have the 500 people that are going pro for $10 a month. You're
introducing a plan, which is like a mini $3 a month plan. Obviously a lot less features,
but just quickly test whether to prove or disprove that if this is something that's kind
of like stopping people from actually converting once they create an account. Let's say that works
well. 20% of the people are now, instead of just staying on free, now creating the $3 a month plan.
So all of a sudden you can see how this game is being played, right?
And then like you can do like what Rohit is saying.
Like, all right, let me optimize for SEO and referrals.
Now I'll have like, you know, instead of 50,000 people,
I'm like creating this long-term funnel of like 100,000 people coming consistently from SEOs
or being referred to other people.
And you can kind of see like how all those numbers can be optimized over time.
You're not going to do, again, try not to change too many
variables with every experiment.
Keep it pretty focused.
What does a growth experiment look like for you, Samaya?
Two things that are going to be consistently dropping music.
That has increased by .
But one thing that worked tremendously well was Vishu making a video about me, like a word about thing.
And right now when you're talking about this, it's just going on in my head.
What if I could send my music to find a few more people like him who recommend music on Instagram?
Yeah.
Yeah, it's crazy how, like this is, it's like a real world video.
at the end of the day.
And if you start playing it and you see some success,
you'll be like, okay, cool.
What do I actually need to do?
So just get to that stage where it becomes
a lot more fun for you, for all the gamers in here.
This is what he said to me when I was talking to him
earlier about this, right?
It's like, everyone's looking for a silver bullet.
It simply does not exist.
You just have to try a bunch of shit.
There's no one thing that's going to work for you.
Even in everything that we talked about here, right?
Maybe one of these experiments works really well for you.
Maybe you have to think outside the box.
And that's essentially at the end of the day what growth hacking is.
You just keep trying stuff,
hella outside the box,
until something actually works for you.
Cool?
All right.
So yeah, each experiment he ran was no longer than two or three days.
He got his decision fast,
whether to continue it or kill it just a couple things to keep in mind as you try various hacks
one is to again not i'm just gonna keep reiterating on this do not fucking spend
forever trying random shit without any results please like no experiment should be like this
multi-week expedition that you're going on and there's no reason to just keep it fast and simple
it's okay and everything you do must be meticulously crafted and executed in the
fastest iterative loop that you can make right so essentially it's like i think i was talking to
abel right where abel went and posted in discord groups and he got i think 20 30 40 i don't know
how many 50 70 fucking people to come onto his site right but it's like he didn't have
he did that great experiments done.
It's like, okay, cool, made decisions fast.
I got to keep continuing on this.
But in that he learned, okay,
I don't have really that many insights
on what else is happening, right?
So he has these people visiting the site,
but he doesn't have any of this data that,
like he doesn't have the infra in place
in terms of like all the data he's collecting
to know exactly how they're spending their time.
So like, okay, cool.
Before I run my next experiment again,
I just want to make sure that I have that in check.
So again, going pretty fast is hyper important.
Who asked me this?
So yesterday Ryan asked me, you know, Stavan, how do you time box?
Facts.
Alright, very simple rule.
Parkinson's law, who knows this?
Rohit?
All right, I'm gonna just tell them.
Its work will expand to fill the time allocated
for its completion.
So it's like if I give my designs 72 days,
it's gonna take 72 days,
even though I could have done it in two days.
And you'll be surprised how fast
you can do a lot of the things
that just time locks the hell out of them.
That's what I tell these lads all the time.
Where if you give the short that you're trying to make the entire day, it's going to take the entire day.
What happens when you only give it two hours?
Because what you can do here, actually, is...
So, yeah, if you give yourself two weeks to update your brand new landing page, it'll take the two whole weeks.
but when you
the beauty of this is when you combine this
with our good friend Pareto
who knows Pareto's principle
yeah
so basically
80-20 rule right
where 20%
of your task list
determines 80% of the
project's outcomes
slash success
so you can
like in in in samaya and cat's case you can spend 20 of the time and get your
sent song 80 of the way there so in this case right where you have two weeks to a bigger brand
new landing page what if i just did two days instead of two weeks for my landing page right
so in this case it's like okay cool just do the 20 you figure out the 20 that's most important
that will get you 80% of the way there.
And then, so in this case of the landing page,
it's like, okay, cool.
If I give myself two days to work on updated
and get 80% of the way there
and 20% of the time,
the two days out of the 14 or 12,
that's good enough for me, right?
Because if I launch it in two days,
I have 12 days now to learn from it
and make improvements and adjustments as in mind
because I've started to collect data on it.
Right? So like going back to Josh and Aiden's example, where it's like, let's say you take the
whole day to put up a short, that's a banger 10 out of 10, right? Or you take, you segment it instead
of like 12 hours, you've got create chunks of 4, 4, 4. Now by hour eight, you have two shorts that
out and collecting data that you can learn from.
It's like how can you optimize to do that? Obviously like it's a lot more
complicated than I'm oversimplifying it but like I hope that like just to
illustrate the point right where you use Parkinson's law and then Pareto's and
then you can kind of like again figure out your time box right and then figure
out okay cool what are the most important things I need to do to get 80%
there.
Yeah, and finally a lot of this just goes back to like as you're going through this,
Jeff talked about personal branding, just keeping things super simple
so that it's easy for people to understand.
Like just make sure that you follow this.
And no need to be Nolan mental model.
Everyone knows this mental model.
I don't even need to tell you about this.
Who's seen Tenet?
Who understood Tenet?
that's the point right don't be like this guy
yeah it's beautiful nah just play all right keep it simple something cool i found right where
oh dude i came across this tiktok i don't know if you guys can see that
150 is millions of views 155k fucking like likes 650 comments 45k bookmarks and 1400 shares
it's like a book which is like don't believe everything you think or some shit yeah you just
click on it and you can buy the book right then and there there's like for the reason why i show
that is like i would urge you guys to go to that account and see how they're doing that because a
lot of those principles can be applied to what you're doing
bro yeah because tiktok shop right now is pushing all products that are like like video native
and they're just like legit like like yo this even i wish i could i could show this video it's like
this book will save you years of emotional suffering in less than 100 pages they're just
flipping through the they're not even saying anything about it but it's like people are
bookmarking i fucking screen i'm showing it to all you guys right it's like because it's like
it's crazy how much like non-traditional marketing right now it's like it's just so different than
anything you would have been taught in school that's why kids that have like no idea about
what's going on in the world of marketing like 14 15 16 year olds are like killing it because
they're just starting from scratch they have like nothing to like reference to it's like again going
back to you're too smart for your own good just try a bunch of shit give it two three days
and see how it can help you and make a decision fast
all right finally we're done questions damn early actually
any questions was it too much like too dense
I have a question.
Yeah.
For the time and money framework,
I was trying to think of it through a clothing brand.
And I guess a reach thought for me was like,
save them money by pricing a shirt less,
but I don't think that's,
that doesn't feel satisfactory to me.
Is there something better than anyone else?
What's an alternative to saving time and saving money?
Energy.
Happiness.
Status.
Making time or making money.
How do you make time though?
By freeing yourself up.
Great.
And indirectly, status, what Edwin just said, is a big part of that.
So like think of Rolex.
These are simple things that I've explained,
but if you actually kind of like go in deep,
like try to apply to like brands
that are like completely out of the box,
like Supreme.
How the fuck is Supreme helping you save time or money?
It's the opposite, right?
But wearing a Supreme, what is that doing?
How is that resulting into different effects?
What about a Rolex?
Right?
Because a lot of these things,
like one of my mentors,
he's the guy who kind of like,
you know every vehicle has a vin a vehicle identification number so he was the guy who
made the software in the 90s to kind of help you do that but he was telling me that yo i don't i
don't even fuck with cars too much but he got this like custom porsche in the early 2000s where
he the reason he got it was if he went into these automotive like dealings like they all were so
infatuated with cars that just the guy who had the best and craziest car would get the deal
Right?
So it's not helping him save time or money,
it's actually helping him just make money.
By closing deals.
So it's like, try to run with a lot of these models
in your head.
Like status plays a big part,
like look at like Bordea, Piot Club,
and what does that do and things.
Like there's, it's super fascinating
the more you dive into it.
We're good?
No questions?
All right, that's it.
