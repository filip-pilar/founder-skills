This is what you can boil it down to in many ways, right? The best designs are one, useful,
two, usable, and three, beautiful, right? And there's weightage associated to each of them, but
by itself, it's kind of like it's still incomplete, right? You can have a design that's just useful,
but hey, maybe it's not that usable. Hey, maybe it's not that aesthetically pleasing to look at.
So all three of them, it's kind of like the holy trinity of design that you have to keep in mind.
But first and foremost, before you actually, there is a process to this, you have to start with it being useful.
It should solve a problem for the user and it should meet a need for them.
And this can, again, be connected back to the ideas you guys are building and what problem is it solving, what need is it solving for the end user.
and if it's not useful, it does not matter how useful or beautiful it is. So you have to like
just nail that part first. Once you have that, then well, it's pretty simple from then on,
just make it usable. A person should not have to work a lot in order for them to understand what
this is. Like who's in Da Vinci Code? Yeah, they're not here to solve a fucking puzzle or
mystery, right? They just want to, they found something useful, now they just want to use it.
Do not make them work extremely hard to figure out how they need to interact with it and things
of that nature. And a lot of the things that I talk about may be taken into context of like
actual web design or app design, but it can be applied to everything. So like think about how
that, how usability applies to you and your domain, whether you're making music or videos
or films or art.
All of these things are extremely important
in every single domain.
And if it's difficult to use,
they'll just churn.
And we see that.
The easiest is you can just look at your analytics
and they'll just fucking churn.
If you put out a trash video
that you think is aesthetically pleasing
but no one interacts with it,
that's your sign that, hey,
maybe they didn't find it that useful.
Maybe there weren't enough insights in the video
that they can walk away with.
So it's, again, a culmination
of all of those things together.
And yeah, finally, this is obviously,
like all of us know what good design looks like.
And I'll talk about that briefly.
But yeah, just make it aesthetically pleasing.
Yeah.
Which would you say is the most important?
Like, is it useful now?
Like, which?
Have you seen the slide deck before?
Damn.
We'll get to it.
But I'll answer that in just a second.
Yeah, but at any point, feel free to ask me.
These are like very abstract concepts.
So feel free to ask any questions, man.
One example of that term that you just went through
before, say, you can look like an out-view
of what's I do.
Picking what, bro?
Or like a trail.
Picking?
I said picking an outfit.
Outfit.
If I'm wearing an outfit, how do I design that outfit for myself
so that it meets those criteria for other people?
What does that actually look like in practice?
Yeah, so, well, it depends on what the film is about,
depends on how the story goes.
Are you talking about films?
I will, I first mention that,
but the second thing was film,
because it seems like I wasn't communicating.
Also, basically, what are you trying to communicate?
What's your story?
How do you want people to perceive you?
How do you want yourself to be perceived by others?
Right?
I wear the same outfit every day,
every single fucking day.
There's, well, there's many reasons for that,
but again, at the end of the day,
it's like, it's an intentional choice I make, right?
So, and that answer is different for everyone, right?
Where a lot of people are extremely vocal
about how they want their personality
to be projected by the outfits they wear.
And then how you can meticulously iterate
and cater that to the audience and your needs
and use feedback, right?
So yeah, finally, make it pleasable, enjoy,
And just make sure that in your efforts
to make it aesthetic and beautiful,
do not sacrifice on usability and usefulness.
Make sense?
So, Brayden, what's the most important?
Again, useful.
For most of the work here, it's gotta be useful.
Right, in some cases, those things are figured out for you,
but you can still experiment.
Like Ryan's a good example, right?
can go out and reinvent apparel from the ground up but hey maybe his version of the t-shirt is
not that applicable to like the ones that we are all like familiar with so he can iterate on that
but that's a good starting point that hey just a t-shirt as we know today so useful
then make it usable and finally focus on making it beautiful
So this at the bottom is the most important. Please start there. Do not start here.
Starting here is no different than the shitshow we see on Dribbble.
Right? To me that's no different than just being a snake oil salesman. Yeah.
If you nail the first two, do you find that the third one happens on its own kind of?
or do you have to like really put a lot of that weight into the content?
Really, really good question and that's kind of like you know when even in the beginning when I
started that I've done this like half a dozen times like I kind of want to walk you through
a process so that you can understand because in the pursuit of making it useful and usable
there'll be so many ideas you already get on how to make it usable right and a lot of you like I'm
sure like some of the musicians here as you're kind of like crafting your your first beat and
you're adding lyrics to it. You kind of already are picturing some version of like the aesthetic
music video that's going out. But do not rob yourself of this process.
All right quick disclaimer on tools because I see a lot of people in this boat.
People here and just people that have gone through this presentation a few times.
do not focus that much on the tool. They're great, but only if they push you forward.
Oftentimes we spend so much time just overthinking what tools and you're rather
off just kind of starting and it's like recent it's a similar tweet that I did I think this
week I can't even remember where just started a similar place and then you can kind of like
figure out where to go from there.
But do not like wait six days evaluating
the best fucking framework,
should I use Premiere Pro or DaVinci Resolve?
Like stop, right?
Just start somewhere familiar and go,
it's okay if that place is Canva,
it's okay if that place is CapCut, right?
It's completely okay.
So I get that a lot where people are just obsessing
about hey Stavan, Framer, huh?
That's the move now.
I go, what do you use right now, right?
Is it going to take you two months to learn Framer
and then two weeks to implement?
Like then you're robbing yourself
for essentially 10 weeks worth of time.
Whereas you could have had 10 weeks
worth of feedback in that time.
So does not matter, but again,
as long as you have something to start with,
just go from there.
Yeah, so start with something you're comfortable with,
ideally one that you already know how to use.
For me, a lot of times, that's fucking pen and paper, baby.
Right, I just go directly in pen and paper
and just like start ironing it out.
And it's also really easy when you do this.
Like this example was we were in Mexico City
almost two years ago, well, 18 months ago,
and we were figuring out the next chapter
for Buildspace at the time.
And we had like a good brainstorming session
and immediately I like right then and there,
I was like, okay, what do you guys think?
Right, especially if you have like a team
of trusted people around you,
you can just be like, hey, what do you think?
And then take that feedback.
So essentially that was this, I just threw this out for them
and I showed it to them, got some feedback
and then just moved on with it.
Again, all done within a span of 15 minutes
after the conversation happened.
I could have very well gone into Figma,
spent two, three days on it,
but again, I'm robbing myself of that.
And I made that mistake a lot in my teens and early 20s
where I feel like we can be better about this, right?
I just don't want you guys to make that same mistake.
Because I see that, right?
Where so many times you guys are afraid to share with us
because you want us to envision the final product
that you guys are thinking about.
But in the beginning, you kind of like, not just us,
but even like you've robbed your audience
of that experience because they're following you
for the journey, not the destination.
Right, imagine if I was making a film
and I just showed you the final five minutes of the film
where the hero's off sailing off the sunset.
Like you'll be like, well, what's actually his journey?
What's his ups and downs?
And you guys are all like that hero
and your audience at large is like, again,
subscribing you to that film.
So please, please, please just show them, like bring them along.
So yeah, when you overcomplicate this,
you create like these unscalable mountains in your head.
So you just have to like break, like even if you look at the logo
that's on a lot of your guys' chest right now,
like the way that was designed was, hey, like we just help you
scale unscalable mountains.
We just make it so that the steps are there for you to kind of just
go and achieve whatever it is that you want to achieve.
And yeah, once you have feedback, you can improve it.
So essentially I got this immediately.
Then I was like, all right, let's not even go to Figma yet.
Excalibur, let's rough it out.
Let's see what it looks like actually, right?
So this tool is called Excalibur.
It's like just this massive canvas
where you can just like start writing on it.
And it feels like really like pen and papery,
but it's still like there's a lot of different blocks
you can use.
and there's some flow charts there where you can kind of like see like okay user comes to the
landing page to learn how to handle their username things of that nature and you can go from there
and once I got feedback on this immediately again this is as soon as we came back this is half a day's
worth of stuff there's a lot more to it obviously that I'm not showing but then you can kind of like
focus so this was again the usefulness aspect the user bill like you know how are the interactions
is going to be and then you can kind of like the one that we actually shipped out uh was this
beautiful pages for like the all the user profiles all the company profiles things like that this
idea of flop don't get me wrong it was trash but hey i we legit shipped it in a span of two weeks
versus spending all this time making it pretty uh creating the perfect flow like interactions
and figma and all it's like no just don't do that not worth it we learned a lot by just going through
through this exercise a few times.
Who's used this, by the way?
Anyone remember?
Rohit?
Radin?
You created a profile?
I'm grateful.
I got the email one day.
Yeah, this is, I think, pre a lot of your guys' day
at Bill's face, but it was fun.
Any questions about this?
