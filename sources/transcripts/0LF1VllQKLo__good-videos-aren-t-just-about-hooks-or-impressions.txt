So, what makes a good video?
Let's open this question.
I guess many things, like story as well as cinematography.
I don't know.
It doesn't come up with one single thing, but I guess story maybe is the main one.
Yeah, yeah.
Curiosity gap, I guess it also depends on what you intend to create.
Okay.
One more?
I think just engaging.
The engaging?
Yep.
How engaging it is.
Yeah, yeah.
There's a lot of things that make up a good video.
Um, all your guys' answers is correct.
But, these are like my four basic like, fundamentals of just like what is a good video.
It's one, storytelling, and basic techniques that we'll cover later.
The types of storytelling that you can do when we talk about Instagram, TikTok, if you're
posting on YouTube or posting on a blog site, whatever.
And then there's the workflow, right?
The building blocks of like, okay, what's the process like?
How do you get an idea on a video format, right?
So yeah, that's all the things that we'll just talk about today.
When you're starting out, it should just be a feeling.
Like I know we talk about like good hooks,
we talk about all these things about like
what makes a good video,
but in the beginning it should just be a feeling.
Like when I was first making like videos when I was a kid,
I was just making like, there was this thing called Hypercam
where it's like you record your gameplay
and I was playing like Counter-Strike Source
and I was just like record that
and slap like a good music behind it.
And to me it was like I wasn't really caring about like
What the intro or what the ending is I just wanted to make a video that felt good to me and so I made it
so yeah
I got like some of you are not in like
The like too deep into like the video making side you guys just want to make videos and tell about your product and show what you're doing
So if you're not used to like making like very intricate details on like a good video or whatever just
make it feel good for you, right?
So videos, they make us laugh,
cry, motivate, makes us do actions, right?
When you guys are like watching a movie, after you guys watch a movie, you guys feel some type of way, right?
What are some feelings that you guys get when you guys watch a video or a movie?
Maybe like the last thing you guys watched.
What were you watching?
Actually, the last thing I was watching,
I was watching this so in Valley, so laughing.
Cool, cool, okay.
I haven't watched that yet.
I gotta watch it.
Yeah.
Anybody else?
Hype.
Hype?
What was that?
What video made you hype?
I was watching Zorro vs. Tango Pike.
Okay, cool.
Interesting.
Yeah, yeah, so...
Even from pictures like they all make us feel some type of way make us want to do something or make us feel something
so
Yeah, when you're thinking about making a video your first video or like you want to continue like a
ongoing process of like what you're trying to show
Most importantly you should it should be something that you would want to watch first
It's pretty basic to know that but like I feel like
Right now we're like what, there's like 46, 45 days left.
And I can feel like people are like scramming to like get, put content out there and make sure like there's, it's got everything right.
But like I think a lot of times like people are missing like the basic, basic like feeling that like, okay, is this a video that you actually would want to watch?
Like are you making this just to post it and like just to show people the world like what you're doing?
or you know like or is it something else right so because very basic if you don't
like it then others won't either yeah and another thing is just don't focus on
chasing numbers right now just focus just focus on chasing something that you
actually like watching so yeah and the point I'm trying to make is good videos
ain't just about good hooks, content, and a CTA.
