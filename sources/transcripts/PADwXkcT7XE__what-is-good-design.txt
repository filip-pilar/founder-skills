This is what you can boil it down to in many ways, right?
The best designs are one, useful, two, usable,
and three, beautiful, right?
And there's weightage associated to each of them,
but by itself, it's kind of like, it's still incomplete.
Right?
You can have a design that's just useful,
but hey, maybe it's not that usable.
Hey, maybe it's not that aesthetically pleasing to look at.
So all three of them, it's kind of like the holy trinity of design that you have to keep in mind.
But first and foremost, before you actually, there is a process to this, you have to start with it being useful.
It should solve a problem for the user and it should meet a need for them.
And this can, again, be connected back to the ideas you guys are building and what problem is it solving, what need is it solving for the end user.
and if it's not useful, it does not matter how useful or beautiful it is. So you have to like
just nail that part first. Once you have that, then well, it's pretty simple from then on,
right? Just make it usable. A person should not have to work a lot in order for them to understand
what this is. Like who's in DaVinci Code? Yeah, they're not here to solve a fucking puzzle or
mystery, right? They just want to, they found something useful, now they just want to use it.
Do not make them work extremely hard to figure out how they need to interact with it and things
of that nature. And a lot of the things that I talk about may be taken into context of like
actual web design or app design, but it can be applied to everything. So like think about how
that, how usability applies to you and your domain, whether you're making music or videos
or films or art it does like all of these things are extremely important in every single domain
and if it's difficult to use like they'll just churn and we see that the easiest is like you
can just look at your analytics and they'll just if you put out a trash video that you think
is aesthetically pleasing but no one interacts with it that's your sign that hey maybe they
didn't find it that useful maybe there weren't enough insights in the video that they can walk
away with so it's like it's it's again a culmination of all of those things together
and yeah finally this is obviously like all of us know what good design looks like
and i'll talk about that briefly but yeah just make it aesthetically pleasing yeah
which would you say is the most important like is it useful like which have you seen the slide deck
before damn we'll get to it but i'll answer that in just a second uh yeah but at any point feel
Feel free to ask me any, these are very abstract concepts, so
feel free to ask any questions, man.
One example of what you
would do last term that you just went through before,
say, you could like to put an out-view report.
Picking what group?
Picking?
I said, picking an outfit.
Outfit.
If I'm wearing an outfit, how do I design that outfit for
myself so that it meets those criteria for other people?
what does that actually look like in practice?
Yeah, so, well, it depends on what the film is about,
depends on how the story goes.
Are you talking about films?
I will, I first mention out,
but the second thing is film,
because it seems like I wasn't communicating.
Also, basically, what are you trying to communicate?
What's your story?
How do you want people to perceive you?
How do you want yourself to be perceived by others?
Right?
I wear the same outfit every day,
every single fucking day.
There's many reasons for that, but again, at the end of the day, it's like, it's an intentional
choice I make, right?
So that answer is different for everyone, right?
Where a lot of people are extremely vocal about how they want their personality to be
projected by the outfits they wear, and then how you can meticulously iterate and cater
that to the audience and your needs and use feedback, right?
So yeah, finally, make it pleasable and joy.
And just make sure that in your efforts to make it aesthetic and beautiful,
do not sacrifice on usability and usefulness.
Make sense?
So, Brayden, what's the most important?
Again, useful.
For most of the work here, it's got to be useful.
right in some cases those things are figured out for you and but you can still like experiment
like ryan's a good example right he can go out and reinvent apparel from the ground up but hey
maybe his version of the t-shirt is not that applicable to like the ones that we are all
like familiar with so he can iterate on that but that's a good starting point
that, hey, just a t-shirt as we know today.
So useful, then make it usable,
and finally focus on making it beautiful.
So this at the bottom is the most important.
Please start there.
Do not start here.
Starting here is no different
than the shit show we see on Dribbble.
Right?
To me, that's no different
than just being a snake oil salesman.
Yeah.
If you nail the first two, do you find that the third one happens on its own, kind of?
Or do you have to really put a lot of that weight into the goal?
Really, really good question. And that's kind of like, you know when, even in the beginning when I started,
that I've done this like half a dozen times, like I kind of want to walk you through a process
so that you can understand. Because in the pursuit of making it useful and usable,
there'll be so many ideas you already get on how to make it usable.
And a lot of you, I'm sure some of the musicians here,
as you're kind of crafting your first beat
and you're adding lyrics to it,
already are picturing some version
of the aesthetic music video that's going out.
But do not rob yourself of this process.
All right, quick disclaimer on tools,
because I see a lot of people in this boat,
people here and just people that have gone
through this presentation a few times.
Do not focus that much on the tool.
They're great, but only if they push you forward.
Oftentimes we spend so much time just overthinking what tools,
and you're rather off just starting.
It's a similar tweet that I did, I think this week,
I can't even remember where,
just start at a similar place and then you can figure out where to go from there.
but do not like wait six days evaluating the best framework should i use premiere pro or davinci
result like stop right just just start somewhere familiar and go it's okay if that place is canva
it's okay if that place is cap cut right it's completely okay so i get that a lot where people
are just obsessing about hey stavin framer huh that's the move now i go what do you use right
now right is it going to take you two months to learn framer and then two weeks to implement like
then you're robbing yourself for essentially 10 weeks worth of time whereas you could have had 10
weeks worth of feedback in that time so does not matter but again as long as you have something to
start with just go from there yeah so start with something you're comfortable with ideally one that
you already know how to use for me a lot of times that's fucking pen and paper baby right i just go
directly in pen and paper and just like start ironing it out. And it's also really easy when
you do this, like this example was we were in Mexico City almost two years ago, well 18 months
ago and we were figuring out the next chapter for Buildspace at the time and we had like a good
brainstorming session and immediately I like right then and there I was like okay what do you guys
think right especially if you have like a team of trusted people around you can just be like hey
what do you think and then take that feedback so essentially that was this I just threw this out
for them and I showed it to them got some feedback and then just moved on with it again all done
within a span of 15 minutes after the conversation happened I could have very well gone into Figma
spent two three days on it but again i'm robbing myself of that and i made that mistake a lot
in my teens and like early 20s where i feel like we can be better about this right i just don't
want you guys to make that same mistake because i see that right where so many times you guys
are afraid to share with us because you want us to envision like the final product that you guys
are like thinking about but in the like you kind of like not just us but even like you rob your
audience of that experience because they're following you for the journey not the destination
right imagine if i was making a film and i just showed you the final five minutes of the film
where the heroes off sailing off the sunset like you'll be like well what's what's actually his
journey what's his ups and downs and you guys are all like that hero and your audience at large is
like again subscribing you to that film so please please please just show that like bring them along
so yeah when you over complicate this uh you create like these unscalable mountains in your head
so you just have to like break like even if you look at the logo that's on a lot of your guys's
chest right now like the way that was designed was hey like we just help you scale unscalable mountains
we just make it so that the steps are there for you to kind of just go and achieve whatever it
is that you want to achieve and yeah once you have feedback you can improve it so essentially
I got this immediately then I was like all right let's not even go to Figma yet Excalibur let's
rough it out let's see what it looks like actually right so this tool is called Excalibur it's like
just this massive canvas where you can just like start writing on it and it feels like really like
pen and papery, but it's still like there's a lot of different blocks you can use. And there's some
flowcharts there where you can kind of like see like, okay, user comes to the landing page to
learn how to handle their username, things of that nature. And you can go from there. And once I got
feedback on this, immediately again, this is as soon as we came back. This is half a day's worth
of stuff. There's a lot more to it, obviously, that I'm not showing. But then you can kind of
like focus. So this was again, the usefulness aspect,
the user bill, like, you know,
how are the interactions going to be?
And then you can kind of like,
the one that we actually shipped out
was this beautiful pages for like the,
all the user profiles, all the company profiles,
things like that.
This idea flopped, don't get me wrong,
it was fucking trash.
But hey, we legit shipped it in a span of two weeks.
We're suspending all this time making it pretty,
creating the perfect flow, like interactions and Figma
No, just don't do that.
Not worth it.
We learned a lot by just going through this exercise
a few times.
Who's used this, by the way?
Anyone remember?
Rohit?
Braden?
You created a profile?
I think so.
Yeah, this is, I think, pre a lot of your guys' day
at Bill's face, but it was fun.
Any questions about this?
