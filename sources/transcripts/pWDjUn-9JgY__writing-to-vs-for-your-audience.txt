meaningful. This is where the storytelling can really come in.
So I know that every time, how many of you have been told you need to know your audience?
Like this just drones on and on and on. And I want to kind of redefine what knowing your audience
truly means. You need to write for people who are meaningful to you. Anybody recognize this
background? What is it? Everything Everywhere. Yeah, this is Everything Everywhere All At
Once, the movie. And when you watch a movie and also listen to interviews, you just know
that this movie was crafted for a crowd, right? It was so obvious when you watched a movie.
And I think it's because when they were crafting the story, they're writing for people who are
meaningful to them. And I was very careful in my word choice. I didn't say write to people.
You want to write for people. You want to do something for people. And if you can do that,
then you'll write things that are genuinely meaningful. Even as simple as this. Hello,
tape is half off today. I'm pretty sure that Anthony probably at some point, yo Anthony,
I know at some point you read a lot of emails. You cut all the bullshit and this was very meaningful
helpful to me.
And here's a trick.
Helpful to imagine writing...
What is going on here? This is bad writing.
Helpful to imagine the person you're writing for.
Do you guys understand what I'm trying to say here?
So, who's the first person you should be writing for?
Yeah, so every time when you show us something, we are always telling you,
would you even stop for this, would you even read this?
Because if you're not convincing yourself, then this thing is probably not going to be meaningful to anyone else.
It's very obvious when you see, especially TikTok, right?
TikTok and IG is a very interesting one where you can always tell who's trying to gain impressions
and all of the hooks and everything are all very formulaic. And so oftentimes if I start to write
with Farza, I would actually write to my past self because I was in a state probably two or three
years ago that I would be like, yeah I want to do nights and weekends, I want to do nights and weekends.
After I can write for a young Jeff, then I would think, okay I'm gonna really think about
a nights and weekends person I've come across,
and this person is literally across from me,
and I am trying to tell this person
and convince this person this is a really good path.
And that is where you can start to story tell.
Let me see.
Can you guys read this?
Hard?
Josh shared this with me. We're both Kendrick Lamar fans.
Anybody seen this before?
Take a moment. It's kind of long, but I'm just going to read.
First thing.
I spent most of my days with fleeting thoughts, writing, listening, and collecting old beach cruisers.
The morning rides keep me on a hill of silence.
I go months without a phone.
How many of you relate to this idea of going months without a phone?
Yeah, it hits hard for you. I do not want to be with my phone.
And so this is actually Kendra Lugmar just telling everybody that,
Hey, I'm going to see you soon, but I need to go do this thing for myself.
And you probably saw the inspo for us. Why?
Because we're trying to figure out how does an artist communicate what's next for him?
How can we communicate what's next for us?
So, if you go to the OS, you will see this one.
We're just kind of iterating, for example, the forward slash what's next,
the what's next email, the 2424,
and all of it is just our attempts to communicate the same message over and over again.
But yeah, if you want to take time, you can read this on the OS.
and I think one thing to always recognize,
and I actually also want to make a side comment,
is a lot of you are very eager and hungry to go viral.
And I totally get that.
Josh and I are constantly like, damn,
why did this one get under 10K?
This is fucked up.
But it's very important to stay authentic.
It will pay off.
I swear to God, this will be the last time I mention Taylor Swift.
I know that Taylor Swift has been mentioned too often,
and this is the last time I'll talk about this.
Anybody know what this album is?
Nobody listens to Taylor Swift here?
Yeah, right.
Who here just hates Taylor Swift now?
Okay.
Why now?
Well, she's been on the news a lot.
Okay.
Okay, so I want to start a story.
This story is actually incredible.
It's 2012.
Taylor was about your age, 23-ish.
She wrote this song when she was 21.
And the song is called All Too Well,
in which she put in the album Red.
This is the OG 2012 album.
And these are the lyrics.
Walk through the door with you, the air was cold.
If you don't care about music, it's whatever, right?
Here's the important part though.
All Too Well was her favorite song,
but she literally thought that,
you know, this is meaningful to me,
but I don't think people are gonna care,
but I wanna put this into my album anyways.
And the fans were crazy for it.
This has become like one of her anthems.
How many of you know, can you guys see these little bracelets?
You know what they are?
What are they?
Yeah, Taylor Swift encouraged your fan.
Actually tell us about what Taylor Swift's friendship bracelets are.
I don't know that much, but they make them at concerts.
Yeah, yeah, when you go to a concert, you can make, I actually never been, I just like studying her, okay?
Okay, now,
you go in my Spotify wrap up,
it's just Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift.
I will share my Spotify wrap up, I'm not ashamed of it.
Okay, so when you go to her concert,
she has all of you make friendship bracelets.
It's actually a pretty cool phenomenon.
Once you make that friendship bracelet,
exchange with total strangers with different messages and they will also all request this
song all too well and Taylor just like totally floored and so two years ago she re-releases the
album Red it's called Taylor's version it's because when she first released the album most of the
songs were controlled by the studio so she said fuck that I'm just gonna go re-record this song
This will be my version and it expanded the song into 10 minutes long still one of people's favorite and
This background image she actually turned into a short film all of you seeing stranger things
What's the?
The the girl with the red hair she actually stars in this it's a pretty good short film actually
Yeah, yeah
Just a character, don't worry about it.
Any questions about keeping them meaningful?
Any thoughts?
I specifically bring up artists as inspo because I think they're one of the best people to
tell stories.
And often times you can actually take all of these lessons to build it into your brand,
even if it's SaaS.
And I'll explain why later.
Any questions?
Yeah.
No, I'm not.
No, I'm not.
No, I'm not.
No, I'm not.
No, I'm not.
No, I'm not.
No, I'm not.
No, I'm not.
No, I'm not.
No, I'm not.
No, I'm not.
No, I'm not.
No, I'm not.
No, I'm not.
No, I'm not.
No, I'm not.
No, I'm not.
No, I'm not.

No, I'm not.
