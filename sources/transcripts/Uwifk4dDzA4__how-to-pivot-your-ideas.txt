So today I want to talk, I actually took some time to think about what to talk about today.
This is different from what I spoke about in SF1.
So I'm trying to kind of like observe all of you guys in the group chat and just watching
you and just kind of pick things to talk about that I think you all need.
I think this is one thing everybody needs today that's in front of me right now, I think.
How to pivot in the early days.
So I want to kind of go through a flow.
It's like, just imagine this is like you, perhaps, maybe someone that you know, and they're going through this flow.
You have an idea, right?
You have this grand idea for something that you want to create.
Maybe it's a school, a track, an app, whatever, right?
You build the first version of that idea.
You actually get it done, right?
You make that first demo.
You get people around you to check the idea out.
So, you know, you go to your friends, you go to your parents, you go to your grandparents, whatever.
it is and you're like hey like listen to this check this out blah blah blah right so you're
actually doing generally the correct things uh people say stuff like this you know they're just
they're just really impressed and they give you like uh all that validation that you never knew
that you even wanted and are now fiending for um and you feel like you're onto something you know
i think a lot of you on this room have felt this so you feel like you're really onto something
and you actually keep making more of that idea you keep going on that idea right whatever that idea
is but a month later it starts to feel kind of dead for some reason it starts to like not really
work in the way that you would have expected like that feeling that you had here is almost like
you're almost chasing it now and you can't really get it back uh and so again you keep making more
the idea you add to it but a month later it's dead um and you no longer really have people who
are checking your thing out but you don't really know why right you're like okay like people thought
people said it was good i thought i was under the right track i thought i just had to do more of that
stuff but now nobody's doing now like the same things aren't happening and so you kind of conclude
that marketing is your problem like you have a marketing problem and you suck at marketing and
that's actually the the your main issue as like a maker of things um you post your thing everywhere
you post it on reddit you know and you get banned from like every subreddit uh you post on your
facebook account from 2013 uh and someone you know you're doing all these things and you just go ham
right and you post on like 20 places um kind of just like spray and pray right thinking like okay
like well i have a marketing problem uh and when i google um how to get my xyz out there people say
to post on reddit people say to post on tick tock people people say all these things so i'm going to
to do those things and you do those things right this is this is actually not wrong right but you
do these things uh you got some more people coming in now right like okay cool like something kind of
worked like something's working maybe a little bit i got like 10 more people maybe 100 more people
checking some stuff out but again you aren't this viral success uh that you would have thought you
would be um and you know you're just you're just at this you're just at that stage um so then you
come here you know a guy named farza tells you try tiktok all right you got steven showing you
all this nonsense all the time and you're like damn like this is working like i can do this
um and you're trying to like you know run after these trends uh so you do this right you post
every day for like 14 days straight and you're getting no views you get absolutely no views and
you are still not a viral success you are just sad and you think that everything you do is failing
now uh and you again you keep working on then your idea for like another four to six weeks
before you either give up on the idea
or just give up on working on your ideas completely.
So this is the flow that I just showed you
that is like a majority of people
that I've seen making stuff,
both in like startup land,
and then also like just me seeing people from SF1
and from Nights, just all types of people.
I think everyone goes through
the same exact flow at some point.
And to me, it's like actually a cycle in a way.
And again, this actually is like the classic cycle
where you do this over and over and over again
until you either A, burn out, or you B, run out of ideas.
Usually it's A.
Because it's obviously very difficult, right?
Yeah, I mean, this is a cycle you all have been through.
This is a cycle some of you are actually in right now
without even knowing it.
So my goal is today to either A, help you see that.
Actually, I can't name a single person in this room
who's not in that cycle right now, so you're all there.
you keep doing the same thing over and over again,
thinking it'll work, and it ended up not working.
Or you do this.
Again, there's two things you're doing.
Either A, you're doing this,
you're doing the same thing over and over again,
making very small adjustments, like tiny adjustments,
thinking that it's gonna work,
or you're just trying wildly different shit
every single day, every single hour,
and then you're a master of nothing,
and you just suck at everything.
So I think none of you are above this cycle, including me.
Either, you know, an example I always put up is this project thing we worked on at BuildSpace.
We spent a year working on this product only for it to never change over a single year.
And it did change, right?
But it was such small little changes that it never made the actual impact that we expected it to make.
And it was only until we got off this thing completely that things started to change for us.
But we were stuck on this for a year.
Like, it looked like this for almost a year.
Nothing much changed.
But we thought we were making big changes.
but really they weren't we were just making like these little tiny steps um every single week and
it was doing fine but it wasn't doing as good as it could have been um or we would do these things
where it's like massive pivots like massive changes so for example at zip school i was fully
guilty of this where i was trying wildly different stuff every two weeks uh i remember one week we
were doing this where we hired a bunch of teachers we had like 50 50 teachers on the platform and
And they would livestream themselves.
And then the other, maybe another week,
I'd be like, fuck this, I wanna make a mobile app.
And now I'm making a mobile app
that teaches kids about dragonflies, apparently.
And again, this is still the same idea,
teaching kids about things that they're curious about.
That was the goal of the Zip School.
But you can't just be doing this for one month,
which is such a deep idea, by the way,
hiring teachers and getting them to stream themselves
and teach kids on a Twitch-like setting.
And then this idea, which is almost like a mobile game
that we were making, right?
They're so different.
But again, this is month one, this is month two.
And we'd be doing these ideas wildly by the end.
We'd be making these wild changes
every almost eight to 12 weeks, pretty much,
which is insane.
So yeah, I see some of you stuck in the stack already.
I think it's most of you.
maybe 99%, and today's lecture is actually,
you know, I said this lecture is about
how to pivot in the early days,
but it's actually about something
I'm just gonna call calibrating.
I think this is very different from the word pivoting.
I hate using existing terminology
because a lot of you already know
what the word pivot means in the business sense,
and you're already kind of biased.
So let me kind of break your definition for a second.
This is what pivot means.
In the business context, to completely change the way
and which one does something.
There's a key word there.
Can you wanna tell me what it is?
Yes, completely.
The key word is completely, completely change.
That is what a pivot is.
But then there's other cool word in dictionary
called calibrate, which is really to adjust
based on experimental results,
to take external factors into account
and to allow comparison with other data.
Now, I would ask yourself, what do you actually need to do?
Do you need to do this or do you need to do this?
Most of you need to do this at this point
because just shifting back and forth,
or rather shifting too much
will just cause you to learn nothing.
So you actually need to kinda just adjust
a little bit every single day, every single week.
So I'll give you an example of like a pivot, right?
A big pivot to me is like us going
from Zip School to Build Space.
Like that's like, we changed like everything, right?
So that's like a large pivot.
Calibrating is more like this, right?
Like nights and weekends, season one, two, three, four, right?
That's us making these very specific changes over a year.
Like kind of small and medium changes over a full year
to make this program better called Nights and Weekends.
And then we ended on S4 to what we felt like was
one of the best versions of that product.
So in reality, what is calibrating?
It's actually just a bunch of mini pivots.
That's all it is.
So now, that's kind of,
so whenever I use the word calibrate,
kind of just want you to think about it as a mini pivot, right?
Mini pivots are just, again, something like this.
Like, remember from S3 to S4,
one mini pivot we did was,
we're not gonna do guest lectures anymore.
Like, we're not gonna bring in people for talks.
We felt like, you know, that wasn't that interesting,
and if it was gone, no one's gonna complain about it.
And we were right.
And there were a bunch of these little changes
that we made every single time.
Can you tell me what this is?
I'm just curious, just from, you know, yes, anyone?
Yes, Ali?
It's just you're training a neural network.
Yeah, this is the training graph of a neural network.
Neural network, very actually simple.
It has a problem that it wishes to solve,
and over time it's trained to solve that problem
based on the data that you give it, right?
And generally it solves that problem over a long time, right?
So the bottom here, we'll call it just time, right?
You give it more time, it's called steps
in machine learning, you give it more steps,
and it'll eventually get really good.
So the blue line is essentially saying that,
you know, this is how wrong it is, and this is less wrong.
And over many more steps,
the machine learning model gets kind of good
at not being wrong.
And it's still wrong at some level, right?
But it's less wrong over time.
And that's kind of how I think about, like,
you know, me doing stuff.
There's many problems at BuildSpace,
and many problems when you're making things.
And it's always worth asking yourself,
where are you on this graph?
Like a lot of times, are you getting closer
to an end goal, like an end solution there?
Because again, the goal for a neural network
is to get good at not being wrong.
And I think that's kind of how you all should think
about your work as well.
You're not ever gonna, your goal shouldn't be right,
it should just be really good at not getting wrong,
at not being wrong.
But I think it's worth showing a different graph now,
which some of you guys may know too,
but in reality, machine learning and AI
is like a multi-dimensional problem, right?
It's like your problems are actually vastly complex.
It's not as simple as just get good and we're done.
You know, like your problems are complex,
whether you're making music, a product, whatever.
It's like hundreds of decisions you gotta figure out
in a given week, hundreds of things you gotta say yes
or no to, like do I post there, do I post here,
do I make that type of content, this type of content,
does the beat drop here or there?
You know, like the onboarding flow,
like do they pay there or not, et cetera, right?
Like the number of problems that you have to deal with
is like, it's like in the thousands.
It's probably even in the millions,
but you can probably handle a couple hundred in a week.
And I'm showing this because in reality,
like let's just say this is your problem set, right?
This is actually like your millions of problems in a graph.
Generally where you want to get to, if you're an AI,
is you want to get to here.
You want to get to like a minimum,
which is like you are minimally wrong all the time
depending on the problem that you give it, right?
Now, what's interesting here is like
there's a bunch of valleys,
there's a bunch of mountains here, right?
So it's like you may think that you're actually right,
but you're actually like maybe right here.
But you don't even know that you could be even more right.
That sort of makes sense.
And it's essentially trying to understand that like
you may right now be at a point
where you think you're doing great shit
and you got it figured out and you got something going,
but you're maybe right here.
You don't even know.
It's because you don't know that this exists.
So it's almost like,
and this is where you really have to zoom out
and really understand where you're at,
in the valley of problems that you are encountering.
I wanna give you a couple examples here
because I know this example is a little bit,
maybe you didn't get it, maybe you just fell through,
but I wanna give you a couple of other examples
of people who both had a lot of mini pivots,
but then also had these really big pivots.
Because again, if all you do is these little mini pivots,
like you're like boop, boop, boop, boop, boop,
and you're taking little steps,
maybe you end up right here, right?
But sometimes you gotta take like a big step,
and then maybe you end up right here.
And then you take a bunch of mini steps,
and then you end up right here, if you do a big one.
And then you keep on going down
until you actually solve the problem, right?
This is PewDiePie.
PewDiePie, in his early days, took a lot of small steps.
PewDiePie is like my favorite creator,
one of my favorite founders, blah blah blah, right?
I'm guessing most of you guys know him.
He's a YouTuber and he made gaming videos in the early days
and he got really good at figuring out the step scenes
to make good videos.
And he actually did just, in his early days,
he actually did a lot of the same thing.
But it was never always the same,
he was always changing the game he was playing.
He was changing the people he was playing with.
He was taking these small steps.
But he also over time started taking these much bigger steps.
Why?
It's because he started to actually want to change his content.
Nowadays, PewDiePie makes videos about his life.
And that's very different from the videos he used to make
where he'd just scream at a camera and be scared
when he got scared in a game.
But again, he had to take the small steps
and he had to take also these giant leaps as well,
these giant big steps, these pivots,
these larger pivots I call them.
While these are more mini pivots.
Another example, iPhone comes out.
iPhone for a decade is really to me
just a bunch of mini medium pivots, right?
iPhone 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, whatever we're at right now.
They got progressively better, right?
But you could argue these weren't large scale pivots
for a company like Apple until this drops.
And now you're like, oh cool, that's a large leap.
And they had to take that large leap
because iPhone sales aren't doing so hot anymore.
So they gotta figure some new stuff out.
Linkin Park, Linkin Park if you know them,
my favorite bands, their first four albums were essentially
like kind of just very small steps forward, I think, right?
Until they finally are growing up and they take these
massive steps in like early 2010 where their sound
completely shifts and now they're,
and now, yeah, they're no longer making the stuff
they're making in 2005, which was like metal rap,
and then in 2015, they're singing like ballads.
And sure, a lot of their fan base could say like,
oh wow, Linkin Park XYZ is trash now,
but to me I saw this and I was like wow,
like the people I saw when I was a kid are not growing up.
And to me like it was an evolution, right?
And again, this caused Linkin Park to find greater success
in the mainstream as they changed.
And this is one more example.
This is my buddy Sharif,
some of you guys have seen him already around.
He was working on this thing called DeBuild.
For two years, he was working on this thing.
Two whole years.
And he was taking very small steps,
I talked about this with him recently,
and he said, yeah, he felt like he took steps
that were too small every week.
He was never making very large changes, ever.
It was always like iterative, very tiny steps,
but never ending up really anywhere that great.
Until he finally makes his website called Lexica,
which was a massive pivot.
He literally changes his whole company from this,
which is something else, to this in literally a week.
And then this ends up getting like millions of people
to start using it in a given month.
But again, he had to take a very large jump.
Do you see what I'm saying?
And so what I'm trying to say is pivoting is not bad.
It is extremely important.
It can be done in very bad ways, but it's very important.
And I think you all witnessed us do this great pivot
on Sunday, well in my opinion a great pivot.
And this is indeed a pivot, right?
This is me telling you that things are changing
in a medium to large way.
It is not a small thing, right?
It's not me taking like a little, like boom, right?
It's like, this is me like jumping across the stage
or trying my best to jump across the stage.
So for us, yeah, this is a very large pivot.
I wouldn't say it's like a pivot in the sense of like
zip school to build space, right?
But it's still pretty large.
And yeah, I think we did this because we felt like
the mini pivots weren't enough anymore, right?
We were tired of just doing these mini pivots
in nights and weekends, and we felt like we got
as far as possible with nights and weekends as we could.
And now we need to take a larger leap
if we were to solve the problem in a bigger way.
And again, if nights and weekends got us here, right?
Let's just say it got us here.
So we started here, took all these small steps,
ended up here, great.
Now it's like, okay, we're here, now we're stuck, right?
How do we get here?
How do we actually get to the bottom of the maze?
And we feel like, okay, if we take a big jump
and we announce this new product, X, Y, Z,
maybe we end up over here
and now we have a chance of getting down there.
Otherwise, we'll forever be stuck
in nights and weekends land right here
and we'll never get out.
And that's called a local minima in math, right?
So you don't wanna get caught in this local minimum
in where you're at.
You wanna be caught, you wanna go to,
what is it called, the global maxima or global minima?
Yeah, so you wanna get to the global minima in this case.
And yeah, I would ask yourself, are you in the local minima?
Like, are you stuck somewhere right now?
Or is there a possible place for you to go
that's more interesting?
Poss, and for all of you, it's likely the latter.
So yeah, you gotta be good at pivoting,
both medium ones, big ones, and small ones.
And they all just really do work together.
A lot of people just think I'm either pivot,
either do a pivot or I don't.
But it's not really like that.
It's, there's like, you could be pivoting every,
you could be pivoting every single hour of every day
if you wanted to.
They all just kind of work together.
So, but I do want to kind of make this part clear.
And I kind of said this earlier, but you're right.
Let me tell you why your ideas won't work.
Like the reality where they don't work.
It's only two things.
Either A, you pivoted too much.
You took these big leaps, you know,
you took these big leaps everywhere
and you really ended up nowhere.
Or you didn't pivot much at all
and then you just didn't change much
and nothing else changed on the outside
and you didn't really get anywhere.
And I think, you know, I can't teach you all how to pivot.
Like I can't give you like these general step-by-steps,
but what I can teach you or even tell you about today
is just some basic questions you can ask yourself
and that I ask myself and that I've just,
questions that I've learned over some time that are helpful.
This is kind of one question.
It's worth just taking 30 seconds
and thinking about this internally.
What do you hold on to strongly?
Like really, like think about that right now.
Like in your work, what do you hold on to strongly?
And take like 10 seconds to come up
with an answer in your head.
And then I would think further,
I would think what do you hold on to loosely?
what can you change right now?
You don't give a fuck.
I can make that adjustment, that change,
and I'm not attached.
You know, it could just, if it was there,
and if it, like for example,
I'm actually not gonna buy some examples right now,
but it's the things you're just not very attached to,
you know, at all.
You just hold very loosely.
Now think about some things right now.
So hopefully you all have some stuff in your brain.
I'm curious, what do you hold into strongly?
Anybody?
What is that for you?
Beautiful.
Like your whole thing is about connecting communities, in this case through food trucks.
Great, love that.
Anybody else?
Strongly, yes.
Making films.
Making films.
That is a great thing to hold strongly.
Anybody else?
Yes.
Some people need shopping assistance.
Huh?
Some people need shopping assistance.
You believe shopping is hard and you want to help fix that.
Great, that's a good thing to hold strongly.
Yes?
Progressively making something different
than I have.
Yeah, so like never being okay with the same.
It's a good thing to hold strongly, I like that.
One more.
Cloud is complex and code is the answer.
Cloud is complex and code is the answer.
You hold that strongly, okay?
Sure.
No, great.
No, there's nothing wrong with that, it's good actually.
You need to know what you hold strongly, right?
And now maybe raise your hand and tell me
if you all hold loosely, you know?
Yeah, I wrote.
Money?
You hold money loosely, okay.
Huh?
Yeah.
Like whatever technology medium,
like website, form, I don't know.
You do not care what the technology is.
It's a great thing to hold loosely, yes?
The design of my UI.
The design of your UI, it's a great thing to hold loosely.
It's a good design though.
Yes?
The type of topics that you tackle.
The type of topics that you tackle, whatever, right?
Anyone, let's do two more.
This is bad, but like,
you're users.
Your users?
Yeah, like you generally hold loosely
what people think about you maybe.
Sure, great, I kind of hold that kind of loosely too,
so it's okay.
Maybe do one more.
Messaging.
Messaging.
Product messaging.
Product messaging is held loosely.
Okay, like you're okay to change that up basically.
Great, yeah great.
So I think, great, that's really good.
Like the answers you guys gave me
are actually pretty solid.
Sometimes you hold onto things really strongly
and you'll never question it.
And I'll go through a couple of examples,
two examples actually, this is Ali's, right?
This is his product, right?
Now, maybe today this is what he holds strongly, right?
He says, I'm just making this up, right?
I'm not gonna, this is just making it up.
But maybe today strongly Ali says,
I just really wanna, I wanna make really great technology
for lawyers in AI, really great AI technology for lawyers,
right, or for people in law, right?
Like that is like a high level kind of strong feeling
that he has, and that's great.
But let's say what's very loose.
This is kind of loose.
It's a product that helps lawyers make arguments.
That is something he can hold very loosely.
Who knows if it's a product that helps lawyers make arguments.
Maybe it's a product that helps like the assistance
of lawyers answer emails.
Maybe it's a product that helps lawyers
get new clients with AI.
Like, we don't fucking know.
At the end of the day, this is what you hold strongly,
so go after that, but you don't need to lock yourself
into this thing, right?
That you can hold loosely, like how you actually solve
the thing that you hold strongly, you know?
I'll give you one more example, this is Nyati.
She made this video, great video, popped up on my Instagram,
and I think strongly is something like this, right?
Again, I'm making this up.
Maybe she feels strongly.
I want to help people be more in touch with their emotions.
That is something that she,
that is the reason she's making stuff.
She wants to accomplish this and get better at this.
Great, it's a great thing to hold strongly.
This is very loose.
She does that via 20 to 30 second short form content.
Dude, who knows?
You don't have to hold that strongly.
You don't have to feel like I have to go
to grind out these 10 second videos now every day.
Maybe it's long form 10 minute videos.
Maybe it's not videos at all.
Maybe the better way to go after this
is to create a network of vetted therapists
and then create a system to connect therapists
to people who need help.
Maybe it's a nonprofit that does something like that.
Again, what's important is
you're not getting locked in
to a certain way of solving something
or a certain path of solving something.
You should keep your mind open at all times.
Like at any time, if it feels like you're just grinding
these out, just to grind them out,
yeah, I would ask yourself,
like is this really the best way forward?
Or do I need to take a large pivot
and do something a little bit differently?
But again, generally the things that you hold loosely
are the things that you can pivot on a lot.
So again, if I go back to Ali here,
Yeah, he can pivot this all day, right?
Maybe today it's a product that helps lawyers do X,
and tomorrow it's a product that helps lawyers do Y.
It actually doesn't matter as long as,
because Ali holds this strongly, right?
And back, same with this.
You know, it could be a network of therapists,
it could be really great videos that Nyati herself makes,
it could be local events that she runs, right?
Doesn't matter, actually, she can pivot around
as long as it, but this needs to stay constant,
because that's actually what is like the core,
that's holding it all together.
And yeah, I think a lot of times
y'all will hold on to things that,
y'all will hold on to things that make no sense.
And it just, it makes no sense.
I'll go through some examples later too,
but I would ask yourselves,
what are some things that you're holding onto
for no reason?
Because there's definitely some stuff.
Because if you just keep holding onto things,
you won't open yourself up to other ideas, right?
You're just fully locked into that one thing.
For example, maybe someone comes up to you
and gives you a great idea to market yourself
a different way, but you're just so locked
into whatever you're already doing
that you don't even entertain that possibility.
I'll give you a really basic framework
that I use nearly every day.
And again, these slides will be online,
so you guys can check it out after.
But every morning, just ask yourself,
what's changing today?
That's really what I ask when I was like,
what is changing today?
Like it's not even like a yes or no,
It's like, what is changing today?
And I also ask myself, what needs to be looked at
from first principles again?
And I'll tell you how this looks in practice when I do it.
That's generally my question, what changes today?
What is changing today?
And I think if you wake up every morning
and you go into your day with that kind of mindset,
you'll force yourself to think about what needs to change.
And again, it could be a very tiny change,
like the tiniest of changes.
Well, maybe changes is like the headline
on your landing page, you know?
Maybe it's a medium change, maybe it's a large change,
right, but something should be changing on a daily basis.
And again, I think from there, first I figure out
if something needs to change, right?
It's like, oh, like, I have this thought in my mind
of something having to change.
From there, you have to just decide, okay, like now,
do I actually do that?
Like, do I actually go for it?
And how do you figure that out, right?
And these are three questions that I always ask myself
before I make any big change.
One, what do others say about the change
when I tell them about it?
Like just my friends, the team.
I show some of you all, you know,
raise your hand if we've shown you a video already,
like a demo video.
Yeah, like I think we showed like seven of you
most of our videos before we decided
if they were any good, right?
Because we were constantly changing them.
I think, Abel, you saw the video like three times.
And we changed it three times
because we weren't happy with the reaction at some points.
You know, what does your intuition say?
I think that's really important.
Like, really, I don't want to bring heart into this too much,
but what feels good to you?
What feels right to you?
And finally, this should be 90% of your decision
is what does the data say on that decision,
no matter what you're doing.
So for example, if you come in in the morning
and you're like, and you're Ryan,
and you're like, actually, I'm not gonna make t-shirts
anymore, I'm gonna make pants.
That's the pivot.
That's the change I'm gonna make.
Again, what do others say?
Are they interested in that?
What does my intuition say about that?
And what's the data say about that?
Do I got some pre-orders for pants coming in?
You know?
Cause then it's easier to make that call.
Otherwise you're just making a random decision
and it may be emotional, it may not be logical.
I think this is the main thing
that I'm very guilty of as well.
I'm generally very emotional when it comes to just like work.
So I need to always like catch myself and be like, okay,
like am I being logical about what I'm doing?
Cause why are we going from Zip School to Build Space?
Like there needs to be a reason.
It can't just be like, because I feel like it.
that's just gonna cause you to jump around a bunch
and then not get anywhere.
So yeah, you gotta balance the logic and the emotion.
I generally say most decisions should be 90% logic,
10% emotion, shouldn't have to be 0% emotion.
This is an example of just like a bunch of mini pivots
that we did on our Instagram,
where every single day Josh would come in
and we would look at what we did the previous day,
we would look at the data, we would look at what people said,
and we decide, okay, do we do that again
or do we do something different?
And almost always it was doing something different.
And shorts are, this is really fun for us
because the feedback loop is so fast, right?
You literally every day, get one out every day
and then the next day decide what changes, right?
And that's a very important question.
Most people will just like take this format,
like we figured out, and then grind out like 30 of them.
And it's like, the fuck, it didn't work the first time,
so why do you expect it to work the 29th time?
Instead, what if you made certain adjustments
on a daily basis?
Again, perfect example of mini pivots on a daily basis.
This example is a more medium pivot.
We don't post on Twitter anymore as Buildspace.
Why?
Sure, internally it feels at some level
that algorithm is changing,
we're not getting as much traffic, blah, blah, blah.
It feels like that, right?
Great, that's not a real answer, actually.
The real answer is just the data.
Our traffic coming in from Twitter
is so similar to our traffic coming in from Instagram,
and Instagram takes like five to 10x less effort from us,
which is insane, right?
Twitter is just, it's so difficult
to actually create good content on Twitter,
and we're not even getting that much out of it.
Instead, we're getting way more out of our Instagram.
This was in December, which we just started, right?
So the data was obvious for us too.
So we're like, okay, we feel like this is a boomer platform now.
We'll be around.
We'll do stuff on there for sure.
But we feel like we're getting a lot more interest from this other place.
So we made that pivot, right?
And that's very important because otherwise,
we're just going to keep doing Twitter badly, like half-assed.
And that's worse than just not doing it all, in my opinion.
You should always just be doing what you feel like really strongly about.
And yeah, I think these mini, yeah, honestly,
it's not the big pivots that are going to make you all.
It's gonna be the mini medium ones usually.
Usually the medium ones.
And I think one thing that you can always kind of like have
is every day kind of coming in with like this beginner's
mind where you just ask yourself,
what needs to change today?
What do I need to look at again from scratch?
And that's some questions you have to ask.
These are some basic questions you can ask yourself.
What was this slide before?
Yeah, sometimes you'll get caught in doing certain things
and you'll forget why you originally started doing them.
For example, many of you I see online right now
making videos on Instagram.
Why?
Like really, I would ask, you have to have a good reason.
And I think a lot of you probably don't have a good reason.
I'm not saying posting on there is bad.
It's more like what's bad is not having really good answers
to hard questions about why you're doing something.
So for example, some hard questions.
Why am I doing this action?
For example, yesterday I spent four hours
making a tweet about our investor update, right?
And I asked myself, why am I doing this?
Does this action actually still make sense?
Like, should I still be tweeting stuff like this?
Like, is that actually the right way?
Or should this be like a video?
Or should this be something completely different?
What other actions can I take?
Or is this literally the best action I have right now?
So no matter what you're doing on a given day,
it's worth asking yourself these three questions.
And yeah, I mean, for example,
like maybe your action is like, you know, I don't know,
posting on Reddit, right?
Why are you doing that?
Does it still make sense?
Is that the best action possible?
Like the best action possible in your current arsenal, right?
Because if it is, amazing.
Go for it and do it, right?
Otherwise, I don't, you're just doing it to do it
all of a sudden, and you'll get caught in that.
You won't even know you're getting caught in that.
And that's what's so hard about this.
Yeah.
So when you are working with whatever project that you have, and you have a larger vision and then maybe smaller tasks that need to get done,
how do you prioritize, what should I be doing right now, today, in business?
Yeah, I mean, I have a talk I do later about how to make decisions on stuff like that.
I just pick one. I just pick one. I just pick one, yeah.
Flip a coin sometimes.
Yeah, really.
Yeah, I'll talk about that later, but I'll just pick one.
I'll do one thing.
Sometimes you have to do a pretty large pivot.
Sometimes the mini, medium ones aren't cutting it, right?
And you have to do this really carefully
because you're kind of in this airplane, right?
And if you pull the wrong switch, you may just nose dive.
And you may just never be able to catch yourself.
So for larger pivots, I always say, you should talk to us.
You should talk to Ahmed, you should talk to one of us
about that move.
For example, like a big move may be like, I don't know,
cat going from making music to wanting to make an app now.
Or like a dev going from wanting to,
you know, help students start businesses
to like making like an AI hardware product,
you know something, I don't know.
Those are very large moves.
And those aren't the wrong moves by any means, right?
But it's like really think through them,
like why are you doing this?
And you have to have really good answers.
So by Friday you all have to be off zero,
because technically Monday,
zero is whatever you were at yesterday morning.
So that's like your zero.
So you're at zero again,
and you're gonna be at zero every day,
every week until the end.
So you can't get Daniel to pay for your app again.
Sorry, that cheat code, some of you all figured it out.
But you won't be able to do it again.
And you're gonna have to try some new stuff.
So what are you gonna do?
You're gonna have to keep exploring.
And I just wanna make sure you all take steps
that aren't too small, but also aren't too big.
That's for sure.
But I think most of us are, what's the word,
victim to the taking steps that are too small, generally.
I would love for some of you all to take larger steps,
but I think most people are usually afraid
of taking larger steps,
so they'll end up taking smaller steps.
You want to kind of be in the middle.
And that's all I got, any questions?
