Welcome again to Writing 101 and Feb 14. Hope that everybody is having a good day so far.
And I want to cover something about writing. And I spent some time thinking about this.
And this is something, a framework I wanted you to start thinking about.
That is that writing is not just words on a page. Writing is more holistic than that.
And I want you to start thinking about what writing really means.
Personally, I think it's the most powerful way to shape the world.
If you think about Buildspace at the end of the day, for the longest time we're really
just people who put words into email, words in a tweet, and then words into a video, right?
And you're literally inviting people into your mind, your stories, and your view of
the world.
I'm telling you this because I get a sense from most of you that you're actually creators
at heart even though you're building different things so anybody seen this particular phrase
if you if you know about this don't don't don't tell the rest right what those of you don't know
what comes to your mind when you see the just one sentence i'm glad my mom died psychopath
that? Stupid? Maybe the model is abusive. What else? Resilience. What are some emotions
that go through your head? So when I see this, actually one of the emotions that run through
me is less of a judgment, more of a, that's really sad actually. And I'm showing you this
because immediately you're like invited, you're actually completely consumed by this one sentence, right?
But I want to show you something more.
Don't ever separate visuals from writing.
It's part of a greater whole.
So this can have a psychopathic tone, can have a very sad tone,
but if you pair it with the, it's actually the title of a book,
I'm glad my mom died.
So suddenly like the color palette and
This picture makes it funny, right? So it's like no longer just something that is a sad or psychopathic
You think it's still psychopathic
I just don't understand the contrast there
The title by itself is sad has negative tones, but then this is bright and I still don't associate
the entire whole or something like, right?
It's still weird.
Yeah, so this particular book actually blew up.
And it's meant to be a comedy.
But it's actually about a, she's actually an actress,
and kind of talks about her mom in a comedic way.
But actually, the meat of the story is rather sad.
So I talked to quite a few of you.
And I know that many of you want to know how to,
this is the biggest one, write a good hook.
Tell a story
Write a cold email
Better landing page copy
The list goes on and on and on
And if you recall
Stavon had a mental model
That was a baby bolt
Looking at some of the stuff that you guys have posted and written
I think it's better if we just kind of look at
The overall process first
I think it all starts with knowing what good writing is
If you recall from the design lecture
good design is actually what's good design according to Stalin you guys remember
usable useful and beautiful yeah there's something similar to writing it needs to be clear
meaningful and persuasive and we'll get to what each of these mean and how we will do that
so clear this is something that I see a lot if people don't even understand what you're trying
to say, they won't even care. And the worst case scenario is that you put something out into the
world, people can't even say yes, and they can't even say no. So they just scroll right past,
right? Or they don't even read it. So here's a tweet, and I'm using a lot of examples, and I don't
actually want to show who did them. This is not from SF2, this is from online. And if you want to
look at really bad writing examples,
oftentimes you could just look at crypto Web3 type stuff.
So if you do a quick scan, what is this tweet about?
Anybody tell me?
It's really small.
It's a little bit of coins.
Yeah, it's very hard to tell exactly what's going on.
So chances are you're just going to scroll past.
Interestingly, this account is actually rather big.
So you need to have people understand you first.
And the second thing is, I say meaningful,
because I want you to communicate something of value.
And the value actually can come in all kinds of forms.
For a lot of you building SaaS,
it could be saving time, saving money.
And for some of you content creators, making them laugh.
That to me is like the pinnacle offering somebody value,
because laughter can transcend many things.
and or interesting information, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
So I'll give you an example.
This is a very popular example of a cold email
that somebody sent to Sean Perry.
Let's just take a moment to break this down, right?
I made an irreversible decision.
So this particular email is because Sean Perry
was kind of looking for people to hire, right?
So let's just look at this.
Hey, Sean, I made an irreversible decision.
just 30 days in i quit some job the opportunity cost of not being full-time in crypto was too high
right lucky for you this means that i'm on the market i think you should hire me and you don't
even have to read the rest he already bowled what he should read i quit this job i think you should
hire me i love to run nft experiments for milk road right so already it's like if when sean got
this to him it was a very meaningful it's also understandable what this
person wants right and before I get to this last bolded part I want to talk
about persuasive if you recall from the marketing lecture we kind of talked about
marketing ultimately is you want somebody to take action it could either
to buy your thing sign up for a subscription or adopt your point of view
And what I mean by my point of view is that you're convincing somebody that what you're offering is a value or convincing somebody that your point of view is actually like the right way.
If you look at Billspace, right, the 2424 lecture, sorry, not lecture, the live stream, we spend a lot of time telling the audience our view of education, how we could do it better, right?
So if you come back to this example, it's very persuasive for Sean to at least talk to him, right?
Because he ends with, I got two ideas, one for Milk Road, one for MFM, want to hear them.
So it makes the reader's life really easy. It's a yes or no, right?
So I want to break down how we start from all of them.
Any questions so far?
Cool.
So, I was looking at a lot of examples.
I think the most important thing you need to start is work backwards from intent.
What do you want to say to people?
I think that's actually a really difficult thing that I have seen in a lot of the examples.
It's very unclear what is it that you actually want to say to people.
and even our own content team, we oftentimes struggle with this.
And this is what I like to think about a lot.
Keep shooting and figure out your target.
Now, this is actually really important.
You need to keep on posting because this is the only way you can get feedback
whether or not you are finding the right target
or even if that's the target that you want.
and think of this as a process and the most important thing is uh you how many of you like
write on a regular basis during sf2 not not for your stuff like you write for yourself
yeah quite a few of you i highly recommend that that if you're not doing that take some time to
do it, our entire team spend time writing about all sorts of stuff so that we can actually wrap
our heads around what we're trying to build. So let me give you an example. We went off grid for
basically a month and we're figuring out what to build. But the forcing function that's really
good for us is anytime we're coming up with something new, we immediately think about how
will we communicate this to our audience? How will we communicate this to the world?
and it's oftentimes a messy process,
but it's something that you can just iterate
even within yourselves.
So this is from my app, Ulysses.
Farza and I, we started jamming about
what's a message we can send to your audience, right?
So if you look at this,
there are four versions of this.
It actually ended up being like six to 10 versions
of just all these different drafts.
You can see a title.
We shut down our company for a month.
I became a monk for a month. I don't know how many of you read BillSpace emails, but eventually the landing title would always change.
How many of you read this or received this? Yeah. So this was one version of our message, right?
And we really thought about our intent. Our intent was, one, we want to tell people that we're doing something different this year.
Two, we want to tell people that we have the same mission, right?
To build a world where anyone with an idea can turn into reality.
And then the third thing is there are different segments of our audience.
We need to address questions, right?
So this one would be Wednesday nights and weekends S5.
And those of you that hit this email is probably because you were in S4.
Actually, all of you are in S4.
That's why I got the email.
And then this is another iteration of the same message, right?
This one is more personal to Farza.
Most of you are probably familiar with founder stories plus cliches.
Steve Jobs finding himself in India while doing OSD.
Phil Knight traveling the world before coming up with Nike.
But this message again is all tying back to our intent.
And our intent is to be clear about what we're doing next
and also provide something meaningful.
and then lastly, persuade them to come to 2424.
How many of you read this?
You can go check it out.
It's billspace.so4.hyper.
It's a very long read.
If you really want to understand where our head is at,
this is actually a pretty good read.
Again, same message, but now in a 10-minute format, right?
You guys all know that we're building software now.
So for a month the whole team would jam about different ideas. I would jam about all of the ideas
And then I made it down to a pitch deck to myself again
I need to I need to first figure out what the hell am I'm trying to say to the audience, right?
So to me, you know, I was like, okay, how do people connect with each other?
So I started breaking down to myself, you know, they're ancient forms of connection modern forms of connection
contemporary forms of connection how can build space elaborate or build upon that
now all of this building into a grander narrative even things like this we'll kind of talk about
this deeper this is like this is the map for the entire live stream and josh and i are thinking
about you know there are different moments that a person experiences in a one hour live stream or
or even a one hour film, you know,
when is the audience happy?
You know, I put a smiley face.
When are they dipping down?
You know, I'll say, you know,
when they figure out S5 is going to be delayed,
they're going to be sad as fuck.
We got to bring them back up, make them happy.
So we really have to communicate
why S5 is delayed, right?
So working backwards from intent
is probably one of the most important things.
That's going to start to make everything else really easy.
But figuring out a antenna is actually very difficult.
