it's about a feeling so there's two types of videos that you guys could
probably make today and that you guys probably see all the time right to me
I'm calling these timeless and memes oh shit my bad just to give a little
content I'm gonna show a video from Casey Neistat this is like a timeless
video from like the past that I always go back to watch that I'm like what I'm
like super lost and I'm like trying to make like a banger video for myself I'm
like fuck I don't know where to you know where to start I watch this video all the
time just cuz it gives me a good framework to make a good video
We'll just watch a little bit of it.
Your bicycle is anywhere from $10 to $100.
The bicycle is not riding the bicycle.
You are a good life.
Yeah, if you want to watch the rest,
It's a very good video like is
Just got storytelling all over it and not only that it's just like it's just a feeling and it conveys it so much through just like
These like not so produced like stuff
Probably shot on like a small little camera, but so this video was posted 12 years ago and
I've put a screenshot of this comment. I was posted a year ago
ago saying this never gets old for the last 10 years I keep re-watching every
now and every now and every now and again every now and then right so that's
like an example of like a timeless video that some people make and I I want to
show you another example of like a timeless video right now that people are
making that hasn't been around for a long time but like you can just tell
like it's gonna be is people are gonna find it in like a yo like this is some gems this is Natalie
I didn't know it in this moment, but everything was about 10.
I know nothing in life is meant to last forever.
Everything eventually ends with one year nothing.
And that's the beauty of it all.
right so I posted another comment on this one or screenshot it so now can you
guys read that I'll just read it out so Natalie I'm so late to your story I've
just come across you yesterday on Thanksgiving but I'll say I'm thankful I
did I watched every video on your channel oldest to newest and I'm glad I
did felt like I was on this journey through life with you living through
your eyes your travels and experiences it's pretty it's pretty obvious that you
know like what this video like meant to this person and what this video is gonna
mean for the next person that finds it so when we talk about like memes you
know sometimes it's not like it just means are just like for things that are
a generational time period like like I'll just show you in the next slide I'll
show you the next one. How many of you guys seen this video? Okay, cool. Alright, how
many of you guys seen this, uh, how many of you guys seen this, like, how many, uh, this
template, this real? Okay, cool, cool, cool, cool. And how many of you guys actually tried
to go do that. I know you guys did. I'll show you another one. How many of you guys remember
this one? All right, cool. Yeah, so let me just ask, so what made any of those two good
to you guys?
Everyone's done.
Oh, shit. What was it?
It's like a current trend.
I'm so sorry.
Yeah, it's a current trend, so it's nice
to see it in different forms.
Right, right, what about you?
Yeah, everyone was doing it, so it was kind of,
there was this urgency to participate.
Right.
And people who executed it well, it was like, great.
Right, right.
It was just familiar enough, but not too unfamiliar.
When something is completely new,
I just figured there's more things to understand.
Right. Do you guys think that it's... Oh, go ahead.
I was going to say something similar.
I was going to say it's a template that you see,
so you're willing to watch more.
You kind of know what you're going to get.
But, for example, you just kind of know what you're going to get
when you see that kind of video.
So you're willing to watch more.
Right, right, right.
Only when you've seen a few...
Yeah. Let me ask you guys.
Do you guys think there's like a...
Do you think memes are bad?
Or do you think there's a right or wrong video to do for whatever context?
No?
Yeah.
So I think they both serve a purpose.
They're both trying to tell you something, right?
Memes are a very good way to just get it out the way in a very humorous or sometimes a serious way, right?
