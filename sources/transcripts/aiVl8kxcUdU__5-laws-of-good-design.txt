All right, so it's new for a lot of people,
I'll slow down then.
So chats, right?
Basically, the C in chats stands for color and contrast.
Simple, right?
Let's just, and again, this is like more,
you have a useful and usable design,
let's just make it aesthetic,
just follow this framework to make it that.
Color contrast, what does that mean?
Who likes this?
Why?
Contrast.
It's hard to read, right?
Anyone actually likes it?
We had a couple of students, I fucked with it hard.
I was like, chill.
How about this?
So one thing that I've observed is like,
with our gen, like we're so internet native that,
you know, like a lot of people ask me,
Stamon, how do you develop the design eye?
where I think so many of us are spending so much time like consuming content like we all have a
pretty good fine tuning on what looks good versus what is shit right so it's like just be intentional
and anytime you come across like a good piece of content that's like catching it's like stopping
your scroll obviously there's a lot that goes into it but just take like a moment of like
self-reflection as to like what it is about that that actually got you hooked and then continue on
your journey of like doom scrolling but like that moment like do not rob yourself from that moment
of self-reflection all right so in this both the color and contrast is fucked and this the color is
okay the contrast is what's the main issue so we can just quickly fix that right just like upping
the contrast and this is a whole lot better than this right so it's like and then you can like then
you can like really play around with it you can kind of like increase contrast and then you have
a pretty good palette to like fuck with.
Cool?
All right, H, hierarchy.
Super simple, read this.
I don't know where that goes.
Yeah, so it's like,
if there's no obvious guidance for direction,
the viewer is going to go top to bottom,
and in most cases, left to right.
Right, in Arabic countries, it's right to left.
So, simple to fix, just make it,
it's as if you're feeding a baby, you know, like mush carrots.
Like, all right, read this one first,
and then read the rest, and they'll be like,
I bet, I'm gonna do that.
Make sense, super simple?
All right, A is alignment,
just align your shit, super straightforward.
This is a bad example of it, obviously.
You guys can all look at it as like, you know, trash, bro.
Even though this is meeting all the color,
all the contrast, all the hierarchy,
shit's just not aligned.
So, simple, align it.
You can also center, you can like then fuck with it,
like a little bit.
But like once you, like again, for next time,
I'm gonna do, like it's chats with like an asterisk, right?
Because like once you understand these principles,
then you have like full autonomy to fuck with those, right?
But it's like, if you don't understand those fundamentals,
then it's like, you're just like,
you're just like throwing stuff at the wall
and seeing what sticks.
Cool, makes sense.
T is typography.
This is important, but not that important.
But like, again, the goal here is to not do stuff like this,
where you're just using like three different things,
even though everything's aligned, hierarchy is there,
color contrast is there.
It's like, just make intentional choices
about the things you're doing.
In most cases, we use one, at most,
like two different typefaces.
Another bad example.
So yeah, just stick to something that you've, yeah.
What's the build-based font?
It's called, it's Manrope.
Manrope, yeah, but we're changing.
Anyone figured out the new font yet?
Custom font.
It's, I chilled, he, custom font.
We've dropped it actually.
So like me with like all this is my art right? So like I drop hints everywhere.
They're sprinkled in. Even before the houses were released, the houses were out in the wild.
It's just like because I'm always looking for that cracked fucking person right?
Where who's gonna like like decode all of it.
a little bit.
Haven't found them yet or her yet, but they're all,
the sprinkles are always going to be there in my work.
And finally spacing.
This is both letter spacing and line spacing.
And I'll talk about both.
In this case, what do you guys think is wrong with this one?
In the middle, right?
So like essentially the line spacing
and this is just atrocious.
So pretty simple to fix.
It also like allows you to like break apart
different components where you want people to focus on this,
but this is just like a tag.
So again, line spacing, letter spacing,
there's fancy words for it, right?
Design school, they're like leading and kind of like,
just make it simple.
Line spacing and letter spacing.
Letter spacing is a space between the letters.
Line spacing is the space between the lines, that's it.
All right, what's wrong with this?
This is almost there, right?
Pretty good for the most part.
Right, it's just like give things space to breathe.
This is too much space to breathe.
Right, but again, just like be intentional about it.
And finally, just try to be consistent
because you want people to like associate
whatever your art is to you.
There's so many times I get tagged
and our team gets tagged on Twitter
with like random black side slides
with like white text in the middle
because that's so iconic to us.
And we're like, bro, that's not us at all.
But it's like, that's what you're trying to get, right?
It's like that level of consistency
where people see something really immediately,
ah, build space.
They just know it.
And first it'll be like in smaller
and smaller circles, obviously.
Like I'm sure even the way the logo was designed,
even a lot of the merch that you guys are wearing,
there'll be people that kind of recognize that immediately
just because they've seen it.
And that's all done by design.
So yeah.
So once you have this, right?
This hits all of the different checkboxes.
Then you can like really kind of like go around
and just like play.
So these would be like the four different colors,
for example.
This was season four, where again,
meeting all the different things,
but then you can really like have liberty
to like play with it.
Make sense?
Yeah.
This is Rolexes.
I just put it in here for reference
because now that you understand chats, right?
And I'm just gonna quiz a couple.
What does H stand for, Michael?
Hierarchy.
Hierarchy.
C, color, contrast, and consistency.
A, alignment, T, typography, S, space.
Super simple.
This is like literally a semester's worth of shit.
But just, it's easy.
Do not overcomplicate it.
But once you understand that,
you'll start seeing it every time too, right?
And again, that moment of self-reflection
where you go and be like, ah, okay.
They fucked up on the spacing here.
But like, that's kind of like what's building that
and training that I essentially.
Cool?
Another one.
So like, if you saw this one and this one,
and be like, okay cool, it's still Rolex.
