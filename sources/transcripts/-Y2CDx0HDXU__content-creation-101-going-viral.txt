My talk today is about the art of short form content.
And I want to start off by very quickly introducing myself.
You guys might have met me around, maybe you've seen me at Founders Inc yelling at people.
But essentially I'm a short form content creator and I've done these different characters.
I don't question, because I'm from Greece, okay?
My great car was designed for tennis.
They were the first one to enter this map.
And they were bored into the map.
Like, they were telling me, okay, how to do this map?
Of course, they don't want to do this.
I'm from Greece, idiot.
I didn't know this from my life.
So this is one of my characters.
And that's a Greek character.
It's a pretentious Greek character.
Now, this is a French character I do.
Rich French European character, to be clear.
So that was European one.
And then there's a tech character too.
So those are three different characters that I've done.
And collectively, all these characters have gotten over 4 billion views
across platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram.
And also Twitter.
I mean, we can't even track Twitter because these are only those three platforms.
and there's a formula that I follow and it's actually so ridiculously simple.
What do I do to create these videos? I create a satirical engaging character.
Someone that is like plucked from a movie or some ridiculous person you've seen at
some point in your life that you've like encountered maybe like in a
conversation with your friends or just from afar. Someone engaging and satirical.
and I showcase these people in different scenarios and for example the rich French
European one it was when his dad refused to give him more money to go spend at a
club whatever these different scenarios I find the most interesting ones and
this is the key part I filmed these scenarios these characters in these
different places these different things happening in a realistic way and that's
That's it, just that alone has created some of these
most viral pieces of content.
And this is for example one of them, the European kid,
has about 1.5 million followers on YouTube,
over 600K on Instagram.
This is the new one I started,
which is my main focus right now,
it's called My Tech CEO, it's like a tech character,
it's the one I showed you, the AI founder pitching to VCs.
We're closing in on 100K here on Instagram.
And so one of the things I've realized, 4 billion is just a crazy number.
You don't really realize what it does.
But I think one of the stories, one of the crazy things that have happened to me,
one of the videos, for example, one thing that happened was,
actually I said something in one of the videos that I didn't realize until after the fact.
So I posted a video, and one of these videos is this one.
You don't even know who you're messing with.
You're messing with me, girl.
You're messing with me, girl.
You're messing with me.
You're messing with me.
You're messing with me.
You're messing with me.
You're messing with me.
I got it.
I got it.
As soon as I find the club, okay, I'm going to take control of your whole thing.
I can't wait, baby.
I can't wait.
So.
So this video, I'll wait for it real quick to end.
This video, I posted it.
And to be honest with you, I edited the captions last minute.
I posted it.
I didn't really think much about it.
And sometimes I just improvise with these videos.
And it's like, whatever.
In this case, I improvise.
I'm the richest family in Europe.
and this video went absolutely the wild completely viral but what happened every
news media like major news news media article started looking at this video
and say he's says he's the richest family in Europe that means he's related
to Berlin you know the richest man in the world wasn't a over 200 billion
dollar net worth I'm not sure actually how much he's worth and then there's this
wave of articles that start coming out is this the other son so really to the
family half of France before I know it sees this video and it starts talking
talking about this and then what happens all of a sudden then even more reputable
news outlets you might not know this one but Le Monde is one of the most
reputable news articles in in France and in Europe and it's like the New York
Times of France and then it comes out with this all the articles like no
exposed this is not the actual Sun and there's this whole massive all these
articles like reportedly false things about this being the Sun then coming out
and saying this is not the case all because of one video I did improvise
video I was like I'm the richest part of the richest family in Europe and
really that I laughed at that when I saw if anything but it shows you the power
of and the sorry this is also another one this is part of the Daily Mail this
actually another video it's related to another video but i want to show you this like daily mail
also the new york post as well they're all picking up these videos they're like who is this what's
going on and so really why am i sharing this i'm sharing this not to like impress you guys but if
anything i'm blown away by the fact that one video that i record on my phone with the right concept
was able to get posted on le monde was able to get half of france questioning if there
was another son of this billionaire and
watched was a video i did about two years ago and it did not get any views about 600 views
But that was not always the case.
In fact, most of the videos I posted at first
were like that one that you just watched.
But what I've realized in doing this
and in posting this content
and in getting these views
and getting these crazy news medias
to post false articles at first
is that there's very specific principles
that I've followed for a lot of these videos
that have helped them get viral.
And what I want to do in this talk
is I want to break down what I've learned
and talk to you about this journey
and hopefully share things that are gonna help you
with any kind of content journey that you're going on.
So another thing here is I wanna also teach you
how you yourself, like I said, can apply this to your videos.
Because I think that a lot of the principles
that I apply in my videos can be used
for other content creators out there.
And I know that now content is such a big thing,
so many people are trying, experimenting with
creating content, you'll find there's a lot of useful
lessons you can take and apply to what you're doing.
So really, I think that there are four keys
when it comes to creating viral content.
And I'm sure there's tons of other things,
but these are just the things that I've recognized
in my videos that have been really helpful.
The first one is you have to think about a hook.
You see, every single second,
especially the first couple of seconds,
are gonna give context to a new person
that's coming across your content
and is wondering what the F am I watching
and why should I watch this?
So the hook is the most important thing.
The second thing is you have to think about
what emotion you're evoking.
What's happening in that video?
How is that video making that person feel?
Now what's interesting about the European kid actually
is the French characters specifically,
is it doesn't actually elicit a very good emotion
in someone when they watch that.
Who is this rich French European kid,
who the hell is this kid it almost makes you angry but guess what that doesn't matter because that
gets views tick tock picks that up and they're like hey whatever this is going on this video
this kid's freaking out his parents for not sending him ten thousand dollars this is good
this is getting us attention we should promote this so that can be a good emotion or that can
be not a good emotion now moving forward i've kind of decided to more focus on a different
character and the my tech ceo character and listening better emotions but something for
you to consider here is emotions can be either way you could be publishing something about
something horrible going on in this world and bringing attention to that maybe i've seen these
accounts about like human trafficking that's not a listening a good emotion in me but i'm still
paying attention i'm curious about what's happening third point is ask create questions you want
people to be asking questions about when they're watching your stuff you don't want to feed
everything to someone you want them to be like questioning what's gonna happen
next what am i gonna watch or maybe getting a sense of what's gonna happen
in a video and then following through with that and this brings me to the next
point the last point which is you don't want to give the audience what they want
what does this mean how many viral videos are on the internet where you
watch them and you think to yourself damn that's such a funny video i have to
watch that like four more times because it's so funny you didn't really get what
you wanted out of that but it like it like triggered you it like you wanted to
watch it again or maybe you watch like a stupid video of someone falling right
you're like whoa like I have so many questions of what happened there but you
watch it again the reason why I give this advice is you actually want to not
give your audience enough for them to be satisfied so they've watched your video
again they're trying to digest what just happened so these are the four
takeaways now let's dive into these and see how they apply in different videos
and then we'll also review some of your videos that we've picked out and talk
about how they're gonna be applied there so yes let me show you how we can do
this now so we played this video before but I'm playing it again and I'm gonna
share with you the hook and what I just talked about okay so that video I
showed you guys earlier I want to very quickly explain something in that video
what's the setting it starts off what's what's the setting who can tell me where
is this where is this what's happening anyone where is this some kind of beach
house right it's happening in Greece I'll give you context it's in Greece
immediately like we see there's a there's a it's filmed realistically
looking right like it's like someone it's like my annoying brother asking for
more money from my dad right that's the immediate context but so already there's
It's like, whoa, this setting is interesting,
and I'm curious to watch it.
And then what happens after that?
The hook is like, this guy is like crying, right?
He's like crying.
He's like crying, he's like,
1,000 euros for some pizza.
1,000 euros for some pizza.
I'm going to repeat this situation again.
No, you're going to give me a physical card.
Crying, physical card.
It's so ridiculous.
People are watching this like,
who is this rich French pretentious European kid?
I have so many questions.
You're not walking away from this video
thinking to yourself, I saw everything I wanna see.
You're thinking to yourself like, who the heck is this?
I have questions, I need to watch this again
to understand what happened.
And that's why this video got 30 million views.
Or maybe it got less, I don't actually remember.
And so we just analyzed that video
and just quickly explain to you
how those principles can be applied to this.
But let me show you other videos too.
Let's try this over there.
Do, because I don't think that you make it.
So just in case we don't pick it up, it says, what the F2 DJs actually do.
Sing the song on the spot.
I think they make it ahead of time.
So what dials are they pressing?
What are the buttons doing?
Is it a volume dial?
Is it even connected to anything?
OK, so why is this video good?
I don't think they're remixing this one on the spot.
Alright, why is that video so good?
That video is actually like, you might watch that
and you'll be like, that's just a stupid video,
got 33 million views, however,
but it actually follows every single one of those principles
that I just talked about.
Like why?
Let's go back to the principles.
First one.
Hook the viewer.
The moment you start watching that video,
there's this girl crying.
You're like, what is going on here?
which actually is part of the third one,
which is asking great questions.
But the first one is hooks the viewer.
Like, you watch this girl crying,
you're thinking, like, what the heck is going on?
And she also has a very powerful hook.
What do DJs actually do?
It's a great question.
I actually don't know what DJs actually do.
I mean, yeah, they remix music,
and they sense the vibe,
but I don't know exactly what the dials are.
So it's actually a funny hook,
like just the words alone.
There's a lot of emotions in there.
She's crying.
It's also laughter.
like what oh my god why is she why is she crying about this emotion being generated laugh mostly
like laughter questions i have so many questions why is she crying what is she doing all none of
those things are answered in that question but it's engaging enough for you to watch it and to
like get enough context to be to be curious about it and again you walk away from this video
feeling like you asking yourself what just happened like I I don't understand what happened
let's watch another one
stop adding my text at the bottom of your resume instead embed spyware onto it so when the recruiter
opens it their computer gets infected and you'll be able to retrieve their password now log into
their accounts and send yourself a job offer it's that easy okay so I like this video too
and I'll tell you why I like it this video if anything from the four principles I just talked
about it has a really strong hook okay so typically if you go on the internet and someone's giving you
advice about your CV you'd you you're expecting them to say something that you would like expect
from a professional recruiter or whatever it is right this girl says stop adding like text in the
bottom of your CV just add spyware like who's like already that's like that's such a captivating hook
because then you're like what else is gonna come out of her mouth that is like
I am NOT expecting and so this video if anything it does a lot of the other
principles too that has a powerful hook and the reason why a powerful hook is so
important is because when you're starting off and you're building a
brand people don't know who you are right people don't need a good reason to
listen to you so the best thing you can do starting off as a creator is you have
to have captivating powerful videos that without even giving like without you
having to tell a person hey I'm worthy of watching the hook itself is gonna
keep them on the video and that's actually something that was brilliantly
done in this video like automatically you watch it you're like okay this girl's
funny like embedding spyware that's not that's not what I expected so let's talk
a bit a bit here like let's like take a pause like why should you follow this
formula that I talked about why is this why is this actually important and how
How much do followers even matter at the end of the day?
I want to say this before we look at your shorts and just on this point.
We're at a really interesting moment right now where social media is totally not what
it was two or three years ago.
There's this, what I'd say, there's like this democratization of views.
What does that mean?
now one of you in this room with the right knowledge and the right skill sets could pick
up your phones and create a viral video was that possible three years ago four years ago maybe but
now more than ever it's it's way more possible because of platforms like tick tock instagram
that have made it easy for hey that have basically said hey if you don't have followers you can still
create viral content you just have to create something that the algorithms are going to like
And so now more than ever, you have your phone that can be leveraged, this little device here, that can be leveraged to reach millions of people.
And that's a pretty amazing thing to know.
Like your phone can be used for a lot of things, but the fact that you can reach that many millions of people,
the fact that you can create just TikTok videos that reach so many people that people will recognize you on the street, that's a pretty incredible thing.
And that's not incredible just because you're getting recognized.
That's incredible when you think about what's possible from a media perspective.
Think about what you can do with your phone and how you can inspire people,
how you can change the narrative, how you can get half of France
questioning if there's a sixth son of Bernard Lanot.
I didn't expect to do that, but it happened.
And that's really why content is so interesting.
And I wanted to mention that real quick
because I want to show you guys the importance of these principles because
these principles are gonna help you create content that is gonna go viral or
at least it's gonna guide you so let's break down your videos
but that's because they haven't lived the life that you have.
They don't know what you've been through.
They don't know what you've lost.
They don't know what you've sacrificed.
They don't get in the journey
because they can't see life through your eyes.
They don't know how beautiful some things feel
or how horrible some things feel
or how horrible some things can be.
They just don't get it.
You know who else might feel this way?
All right, so I have some feedback on this video.
First off, my hyper-engaging mind says one thing.
It's too long.
It's too long, and you need to narrow this down.
What is the fundamental thing you're saying here?
And narrow this down.
This should be half as long as it is.
And I actually don't know how long exactly it is,
but it should be half of whatever it is.
the first thing that was also um where's the hook the hook is starts off with this little seagull
but um i think the hook that's more interesting is what you're is what you're saying right like
what are you what like what you're saying is more interesting than the seagull even though
like it is kind of fun it almost feels like a cool little film you start off with with a seagull
and golden gate bridge but that's not a strong enough hook um and it doesn't actually segue
into what you're doing.
Like when you start a video,
you want to give your audience
a suggestion of what's about to happen.
And if you're starting your video
with like one completely different frame
and then the cooler part is the second frame,
you're not really like,
the audience is not going to stay
to see the second frame
because they think the video
is going to be like the first frame, right?
So starting off, I'm thinking to myself,
this is about like a seagull.
And then it's like, no,
this is about some dude
pulling out some interesting motivational lines.
like so like you should start off with that and you should think to yourself
hey how do I take what I'm saying and make it like way more engaging and focus
on 20 seconds of hyper engaging like lines and just try that and take just
take one concept or break this down into three videos and for the different
concept because there was a lot there said and I if you do that that means
when I watch this video I'll have I'll remember it exactly what you said because
I think there's a lot there's a lot said here and I think it was powerful but I'm
I'm starting to remember everything that was said
just from that video.
That's my advice for this video.
Let's go to the next one.
This is a work of art.
This is bullshit.
This is a work of art.
This is bullshit.
This is a work of art.
But this, this is bullshit.
Principle Zandreski.
Okay, interesting.
I think this has potential,
But the first thing that strikes me is like,
there isn't enough context.
There isn't enough like,
like I don't have a good idea of what I'm watching.
Like this is a work of art, this is bullshit.
That's kind of funny.
But I feel like it needs more concept.
I think there's, the fact that it doesn't have
enough context means that there's gonna be a drop off,
which means there isn't really enough of a hook
in this video.
You start watching this, you're like,
what am I watching?
Like, what's gonna happen?
You don't really know that.
So maybe there should be some form of a title.
There should be something more that gives
the viewer more context and understands what's happening.
I don't really understand what's happening
as much in this video.
So I feel like that needs to be established.
What I do like about this video though,
is it's actually very unusual to come across a video
where there's chess being played.
And I think that's actually interesting.
That's interesting because like,
not everyone's like looking at chess on their screen,
unless they're like chess pros and stuff.
So already you have actually like a different type of content
that's being viewed, which is changing the dynamic
and it's changing what people are used to seeing.
So more context, a better title, what's going on,
those like, you don't have to like make it abundantly clear,
but slightly more clear for me to be interested
in seeing what's gonna happen.
Like for example, if I was gonna do a video about chess,
It's like, for example, like random come up with an idea,
right, like this guy, like chess player beats opponent
in five moves.
And then I would be curious just to watch those five moves.
And then just like, I know what's gonna happen.
I know it's like this guy's gonna get beat,
but he's gonna do it in five moves,
and then I can see it.
Like for example, that would be a video
that I would come up with.
I really don't know what's going to work out.
I don't know.
I'm using this.
Cool.
I like this video.
Doesn't this video kind of make you feel like good inside?
It's like, ooh, this is nice.
Like very like smiley, like a nice little music in the background.
Like high production quality, like that cool shot where like she's sitting down.
So already this video, what I think is hitting is like,
it makes you feel good.
It makes you feel good.
And it's like, that's enough of a reason to watch it.
But one of the things I didn't really understand was,
I think again, there wasn't actually that much context.
I was kind of curious, it's like, what's going on?
Like, the motion is, you elicit an emotion,
but then I'm curious, like, what's happening, right?
Like, in the video.
Because it's hard to follow exactly what's happening.
Like, what is episode one?
But maybe that's also a good thing.
Maybe that's a good thing
because then it gets more questions being asked.
So this is like really one of the things you have to realize.
There's always a fine balance
between giving people what they want in more context
and also getting people to ask more questions.
There's a fine balance.
If you overdo it,
then people know what you're gonna serve them.
They're like, okay, I know what's gonna happen next.
But if you're underdoing it,
you're gonna come across a chess video
and you're gonna wonder what does the bullshit thing mean?
Right?
So I like the fact that this elicits a reaction.
I want this to have more of a concept,
and I think it does ask a lot of questions,
but I feel like it needs to slightly veer
on the side of more context.
Let's see this one.
Huh, that's interesting turbo
Okay again like
What did I say about the chess one I said?
this guy
say
So it's not content um
Context yeah, yeah context
this chess player
Beat the opponent in five moves you go there. You know you're watching
What do I these videos are actually similar both of them
have two different types of contents
that I'm not used to seeing on my feed.
I don't usually see robots playing soccer,
or football, whatever you wanna call it.
So already, it starts off really cool, interesting,
but there's no title, there's no context,
and I feel like you want that,
because you want to give the audience
some sense of what's happening.
Maybe you could just be like, hey, I built a robot,
or maybe like for example like random like right it's raining it's raining
outside so I built a football I built sorry I built a robot to play football
boom it's raining it's like it could even be like a text like a like an AI
voice it's raining outside today so I built a robot to play football inside
boom that's like a 15 second video and I know what's happening you built the
robot place to play football right done as opposed to just shots of this playing
I know what this is, I know what's going on here,
but there needs to be more of a compelling concept
around the video.
It just feels like a lot of like feeling trapped and feeling stuck.
Oh, oh, sorry, sorry.
Feeling like people don't understand you and that people are just...
Um, all right, let's, let's, let's, let me talk about this.
Um, okay, so, a lot of emotion.
That's for sure.
F this.
I think that video actually, so I'm trying to think.
So that video, it has a very short,
so again, I'll go back to the different thing.
It starts off with him talking,
and then it pans to this other shot of him going around
and then talking about the lyrics to the music.
I think that, I think an audience,
you need to jump to that faster.
Again, if I'm watching that first scene,
I don't get a sense of what's happening in the second scene,
and I already may have scrolled off.
So I would jump there faster.
And in your case, maybe the concept of the video
is not that important.
Maybe you want to listen to more questions.
But what that video is really doing
is it's striking emotion.
It's like, boom, it's like this is a song that I made.
And you can kind of feel the emotions being
conveyed from that song.
So I think what I would do is almost break that video up
and jump to the song faster.
And if you want, you could also add more concept.
You could be like, I made this song.
I don't know, for example, you could be like,
I made this song after my girlfriend broke up with me.
And it's like, I don't know.
For example, the internet would probably find that funny,
but that would still do well.
I don't know, that's one idea.
But it's a cool video.
Actually, this is probably less in my area of expertise
as a content creator.
I feel like that kid who has already tried it
but no one can't get off them.
But I think also the starting are good.
Anyways, let's skip, oh gosh.
Let's skip to the next one.
It all started when I met Hamal and Joshua
waiting in line for a sweatshirt at a conference.
Now we're a team of four,
based in the London and San Francisco.
And we're building our idea
at a program called Build Space.
It's called a T-Mine.
It's an app that helps people with diabetes track their activities and understand how
those activities affect their blood sugar.
It's inspired by a team member's issues.
She was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at an age or two.
We're also put in the community with Diabetics through our social media.
Follow along to see how many people we can help in just seven weeks.
Can we do this?
Can we do it?
We just have to do this.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Cool.
Okay.
So.
Too long.
and it felt like a corporate video which I understand the reasoning why someone
would make a video like that because it looks it looks good but like it felt
like a bit of a corporate video right sitting down like this is the one thing
you have to remember is like when you think about content as a first-time
content creator you think to yourself about what's going on on the internet
right now or what you've seen right so naturally when I first created content I
thinking like oh there's you know how there's like all these like videos of
like people going on trips and stuff and like filming those and those go viral so
why don't I try that no no in fact I like to do what like Tim Ferriss says
like do the opposite like instead of sitting down making it look like a video
you've seen in the past do the opposite because people are used to those videos
and so that's that's that's one that's one comment one critique the other one
is it's a it's too long because there's a lot of different concepts I think you
want to focus on what is the key concept right like you talk about the startup
right you talk about how you met your co-founder if I remember correctly how
you met your co-founder the startup you're doing and then like the end about
how you're like missing school or something like that those are too many
concepts right those should be each individual videos how did I met my
co-founder that's one video in itself right so I think I'm not saying you
should shoot this video in a I'm not saying you should all right I'm not
saying you should shoot that video in like a ridiculous way like I shoot my
videos or it looks realistic but find something that's gonna be more
captivating and then is it less of what people are used to seeing that's that's
the key point and maybe that doesn't work but that's my feedback if you want
to to create more of a viral video otherwise I like the script and I think
there's something there that would be the only critique
It seemed that the things that made me happy at the time made them miserable.
So the only solution I had was to live two different lives.
One version at home and another when I was in university.
It felt like my family didn't really know me.
The lines between my two identities became very blurred at a certain point,
and eventually I forgot who I really was.
After five years, it became harder and harder to live my double life.
And so I stopped.
I like this video actually. So a couple of things. Number one is like this is a really nice like story. And I think this is a really cool like style of video that I actually don't know as much about, but I think it can work really well on the internet.
and obviously did I mean it has 68k views it's pretty pretty solid but I think one of the things
I would do here is I thought the b-roll was I feel like there could be different b-roll in here
like it's like you like moving around like drawing on a board like I think the story is really good
and I also even like the captions like I even like the text it like kind of fits into this
but I feel like the b-roll could be kind of different I think the the b-roll could be more
I don't know what it would be like,
but I feel like there's something there
that's less of you just like walking around
build space and doing things
that could make this,
that could fit into the video more, right?
That could be interesting.
And honestly, what would be really cool
is as we see AI progress more and more,
it'd be really cool to see if AI could create,
if you could take that story
and then have AI create like some kind of cartoon,
like fictional cartoon story
of like what you just explained.
Like my ex, like Korean,
like going back and forth to see him
living a double life.
um so yeah so i like the story and actually this um is probably different than some of my videos
where it's like all about really hyper engaging i think you're optimizing here for an audience
that's invested in the story and curious about what's going on and even still you're still left
with some questions you're still left kind of curious about like like what happened after uh
uh why is he's your ex obviously so how did you guys break up um so people are kind of invested
in that story um and i think that what's really important is content's constantly changing
sometimes you do the super engaging stuff sometimes you do the yelling on the phone asking
your dad for more money things which is the stuff that i've done right but like people like to
consume different types of content and their tastes change right so sometimes this sometimes
this slower paced content does better because people are less used to it so it's actually up
to you guys as content creators to experiment and to find hey what is the
taste of content right now what do people want right now right because it
changes constantly there's always an influx sometimes people don't want
high production podcast reels super well edited right they want something more
raw and unfiltered and interesting so one of the things I like this video about
one of the reasons I like this video is hey this is not the hyper engaging like
every second counts video this is a I want the audience to hear a story that's
personal and get them invested in that so I kind of like that I think what's
really important here is like every time you're creating content like don't
forget like the best content starts with a with a good fun idea that you're
invested in the moment you start shooting content and you're thinking
to yourself I'm dreading this process you're not really doing it right like
what are the chances that video is gonna do well you want to pick an idea that
you're like hey this is fun this is interesting I want to try this out I want
to get this communicate this and then focus on that experimenting here is like
the most important thing you can't think content you can't think about what's
gonna go viral you have to experiment you're not a pro you're not a pro in
thinking about you're not a pro in understanding what's gonna go viral
unless you're experimenting and getting real-time feedback right I can't think
I think my way to a viral video.
I have to experiment.
Like, oh, this didn't work.
Oh, the title was too long.
Oh, the audio wasn't good enough.
And then I start to build a foundational knowledge
around what works from experimentation.
Double down on what works, of course.
Like, this is easy and simple,
but it's really the truth, right?
Like, once you find something that works, keep doing it.
Like, the moment we had a viral video
with the European Kid character,
it made sense to keep doing that and then to take that same concept and to to like spread that into
different characters that's why i started the other tech account completely different character
but very similar style right filmed in a very realistic way very engaging shots and that has
gone viral i mean that's almost at 100k on instagram and i started that a couple months ago
so double down on what you know works and another really important point here is like
each one of you guys has different talents each one of you brings something
different to the table one of my talents honestly is the fact that I can go from
this to I'm a rich French European kid and I'm presenting to you I can improvise
I can come up with accents that's not your talent that's mine so it works well
for tik-tok you guys have something different to offer or maybe you have the
same thing I don't know but my point here is like there's something inside of
of you guys that you can take and put into your content and you can elicit like can you can put
into your content right for mr. beast it was something completely different it was this just
like obsession with like looking at the algorithm studying content seeing what does well and just
being really obsessed about the whole process of you know creating a long-form content and coming
up with the most viral video ideas that appeal to the masses that's his genius right so you have to
find your genius and find about how you can put that into your content right so
that's probably one of the most important things you need to do here
because you can't copy people like yes you can copy people and get some success
but then at the end of the day if you're copying someone else's talent and you
don't have that talent it's not gonna work for you right so find what you're
interested in what you're unique at that's I can't emphasize that more
because the truth is when I started the European kid my brother I didn't think
I think to myself, I didn't find someone else
that was doing that and just copy them.
I'd explore that concept myself and just try that out.
So very, very important.
And we can do this right now.
If anything, it's less about creating a video right now
that's gonna go viral, it's more about,
how would we think about a video,
based on everything we've learned,
that could go viral right now?
So let's think about a video.
What do you guys say?
And we're gonna get you guys involved.
So let's think about a shot.
That's a shot we could do.
One shot we could do, I'll suggest,
is me presenting something on stage
and someone in the audience says something.
That's one shot.
What do you guys think we could do?
A viral video right now.
Just this context.
Go ahead, raise your hand.
Go ahead.
I would've just recorded you jumping into doing
your improv thing and then I would've written
this person is a fraud or something.
Perfect, I love that.
Yeah, so it's like film from your perspective.
It's like this, or you know one concept
I just came up with, this guy has two different personalities.
So it's like me talking, American accent, like this,
and then switching into another character.
It's like, that could be a concept right there.
It's like this guy switches into two different personalities.
Anyone have anything else to say?
It could be random ideas.
We can turn it into a viral video.
Anything.
Go ahead.
a lecture on how to make a viral shot?
Yes, that's a good one too.
Let's think.
Lecture on how to make a viral shot.
It's a bit broad, but it could work.
It could work.
You know a video that did really well, actually?
There was this girl and her professor.
So there was this girl in this class,
and her professor had on the board, he said,
your task is to create a video that
will get 1 million views.
And what did she do?
She just took her phone out,
and she recorded the professor talking about that,
and then she just posted it saying,
can you help me?
And she got a million views.
So it's kind of funny how when you're creative,
anything can be a viral video.
So we talked about the concept of me switching personalities.
We talked about the concept of how to create a viral video.
What's another concept?
Go ahead.
Like someone from the audience filming
and the caption would be like,
this dude thinks he's Steve Jobs,
and you're giving him over the top,
Apple style presentation.
Perfect, yeah, perfect.
Yeah, that could do well.
That would focus, then the focus of that content
would be on me doing a really good job
at pretending like I'm Steve Jobs.
That's great, that's great.
Anything else?
Yeah?
You were teaching about how to make a wire audio,
but you were only in a towel, wrapped in a towel,
like you were very interested.
I'm wrapping a towel, okay.
Yeah.
And then you go on to the last point
and you're like this is the last point,
how to make, and you start taking off the towel
and you cut midway at the video ends.
That's a great idea.
Could get removed from TikTok, but it could work.
It could work.
So it's like, and lastly, I'll show you guys
how to make a viral video.
And I started just taking my clothes off
and I wrap a towel, and then we go, and then yeah.
That would probably do well.
probably elicit a lot of questions.
Yeah, I won't do that for the sake of my brand,
but that is a good idea.
If you want, you can do it.
If you want to, yeah.
We do music in the background.
Yeah, yeah.
Some music in the background.
I could be yelling at you at the same time.
Yeah.
I love all the ideas.
What I wanted to communicate here is like,
hey, you can literally take any idea,
like any context, like even just the stage,
and the fact that you guys are here,
and turned it into an interesting, engaging video.
It's crazy when you think about it.
So that's really what I wanna show you guys here.
We don't have to create an actual video.
And, sorry, yeah.
Do you guys have any questions for me?
I'd love to answer any questions
or anything you would want me to comment more on.
Please.
So, your, I guess, your strap for the satirical character,
Was that just something that you, I guess, came to after observing how the marketplace responds to content and experimenting?
Or did you get this output from somewhere else?
That's a good question.
How did I come up with the character?
I think it came from, obviously, there was a bit of experimenting at first.
but like very quickly i tapped into my skill sets which is like oh i could be like i can do like
accents and so i think the moment i did that and i tried like just filming that like first
realistic looking video of this guy with this accent that did really well and so instantly
from experimenting and like kind of being like hey i'm like showcasing all these like before i
was like showcasing cars i was like showcasing like scenery i was like that's not getting me
that many views because am I like an incredible photographer
or videographer?
Like, I'm not.
But like, what if it was the camera was on me
and I know I could do decent accents, right?
So it was kind of just moving towards what I thought
I was kind of good at and then seeing the response
of those videos being posted on TikTok,
which was the first platform I was on.
So yeah, if that makes sense.
Yeah.
Questions?
Yeah, my question is like, how much does this apply
to more long form and just normal YouTube videos
for contacts that make educational style videos
on YouTube helping people to make apps and software?
Cool.
Okay, so I think that my thought process is
I think that if you have the short form skill sets,
long form, and you can dump, and those work,
long form will come and you'll be even more engaging
for long form and you can even think more
about the concept.
I think what matters for long form is like,
you need to really like know exactly like the content
that is gonna be presented.
I think short form is all about like hyper interesting
short videos that are shareable, that's what it is.
Long form is like what's the key concept you're sharing?
Like in your case, maybe this advice doesn't apply as much
because people are willing to sit down
and hear what you have to say about how to build an app
or how to design something for maximum scalability, right?
So really, the focus is on what are you sharing,
how compelling is that?
Now, if you tell me that you have long-form content,
but you don't really have something interesting to share,
then why the hell should I listen to you?
That's the case for most long-form creators, right?
That's, but, so my advice is start with a short form,
learn how to master the art of attention.
And then if you have something really compelling,
you'll have a better sense of how to do it long-form.
Or if you have something compelling from the start,
start with long form, or I would then challenge you,
can you take those interesting small tidbits
and throw it into short form?
That's what I would say.
I don't know if that answers your question.
Cool, yeah.
Go ahead.
Yeah, so my question is,
so basically a lot of us are building products,
AI apps, software, whatever.
So basically our main thing is not the content itself,
but the content is what we hope to use
to get more people, to get more attention
whatever else we're building.
So further my question is,
do you think this changes anything with what you said?
And then, in this case,
would you focus on making videos and content
about our product, or more about ourselves,
our journey and everything,
and then hope to get people to the product?
Say the beginning part, you said you're building what?
Like an AI op.
An AI op?
Yeah.
Okay, so it's just focusing on the product?
Yeah.
Okay, and tell me more about your product real quick.
Like a quick one-liner.
I use AI to help you with analytics for your business.
Okay, analytics.
What kind of customers?
What kind of customers?
Other startups.
Other startups.
So B2B founders, startups, how much funding would they have?
I mean startups with money, everybody's-
Startups with money, like seed series A, series B.
Seed.
Okay, cool.
So you just described your demographic, right?
Your target customer.
Here's why I think content's important for you, right?
There's like multiple, so B2B companies have like
a couple different ways they can reach their customer.
Number one is just directly go to your customer
and try to email cold outreach to get to them.
How many emails do you get as a B2B founder cold outreach?
So many, it's super saturated.
Unless you have a really good cold outreach strategy
that is really converting, that's really hard.
My suggestion is how is content useful?
Content is probably useful
because if you're getting the attention of founders,
so actually what's brilliant about my content
for the tech one, it reaches that exact demographic.
And that was on purpose, done.
I didn't do that by accident.
I didn't by accident reach tech founders with money.
It was because I wanted to do that.
I wanted to network with more of these guys.
So my advice to you is, hey, what's content
that they would want to consume?
And that doesn't necessarily have to be
about data analytics.
That could be, for example, in my case,
that's a pretentious tech CEO, right?
But I have their attention.
And so now I have a way to introduce myself to them
that most people don't introduce them.
Like if I wanted to launch a B2B product,
I would just go to my account
and start creating funny videos
around the B2B product I was launching,
and then I'll start DMing founders
that are watching my stuff.
I'm differentiating myself from everyone else
that's reaching those clients with cold email,
with paid ads, all these things,
and that's all organically through an account
that I grew without spending,
I mean, maybe I spent some money on equipment,
all that kind of stuff, my time.
But my point is, dude, you can reach people
in so many different ways,
and you can reach people if you're targeting the right people
with organic content, right?
That was a lot there, but that's my thought process
around that, I have a lot of excitement around that,
so yeah, I don't know if that made sense.
Cool.
The main question is like, okay, I have a product,
you mean it's about the product, like I show the product,
I do labels, I do things, or I just start to grow
an audience and then capture those people
that my product is for?
You can, you can, but dude, your product's boring.
Like why would your product go viral?
Yeah, no, exactly.
It wouldn't.
But what is something that would go viral?
What is something that would go viral?
I mean, I just did, I showed you
the AI startup founders pitching to VCs.
What is something that will go viral?
And I'll go to you in just a second.
Anything else that they're watching that's tech related,
that's even related to data analytics.
You don't have to plug your product.
The product doesn't have to be what goes viral.
what goes viral is the concept that's gonna attract those people and then
they'll you'll find a way to sell that to them maybe you have your link to your
website there or you have a video just about that that's pinned to your profile
there's tons of ways to sell them once you get their attention so I would say
don't focus on your product especially if you're b2b like sass like dude b2b
sass like so boring like you've got to focus on the attention and then you can
find ways to actually sell the product build the community first well I mean
build a community and then find ways to sell it.
Yeah.
I hope that helps.
I know there's a question over there.
I was going to say, like, you could even go with
similar content to what you're doing, which is just
like, funny, like,
oh, I had to give this, my
investor asked for this number,
and like, the person's up all night
trying to get it or something.
So it's just like, you know, you don't even pitch your problem.
Just like that person, the person who's like, oh, yeah,
I had to do that. Totally.
They're curious,
and then they go and see why .
Yeah, that also gave me an idea for a video.
Like, I think that BuildSpace does this really well.
Actually, I haven't really thought about this.
What BuildSpace does well is like,
for the videos that they make,
there's always like, it's like showing a challenge
that someone's trying to overcome.
So naturally when you're watching that,
you're like, oh, I kinda wanna help this guy.
Like, I think your video in Vryal, right, Brayden?
It was like, this is Brayden,
like he has to get X number of users.
Like, it's actually an interesting concept
of showcasing a challenge,
and then people are engaged in that.
So you could even do something where it's like,
we launched this product,
now we're trying to find customers,
our investors are knocking on the door,
asking us for updates.
I don't know, I'm feeding you random ideas.
There's tons of stuff, you could do something around that,
you could do something around,
hey, it's not even related to the product,
it's related to what we think tech CEOs
are gonna wanna watch.
It could be something about the new SOAR update,
whatever it is, right?
There's tons of different things here.
Oh yeah, I thought that was an interesting point.
Yeah.
Was there another question there?
No, okay, cool.
Anything else to discuss?
Viral video ideas?
Oh, go ahead.
What's your take on clickbait?
Like, do you think it's important?
I guess, like, not only clickbait,
because it's more YouTube, like,
you talked about the importance of the hook,
like, the first, like, five seconds video.
it possibly have live content that has maybe left left click kind of draw you
yeah it is but like you're trying to build a brand so like sure no one for
like just like click baby videos like I never get what I want when I watch these
videos like F this guy dude I don't want to see his content so like you're
building a brand you can do click baits it works short form it works short term
but like long term people are gonna watch your videos and they're gonna be
be like, this is the guy I want to avoid watching.
For YouTube, it's different.
For YouTube, it's different also because for YouTube,
it's like those guys are just so desperate for you
to watch their video because they know that once you start
getting view time, that's going to help them.
So they'll almost think about clickbait differently.
But I'm thinking about this from a short-form content
perspective.
Yeah.
That helps.
Oh, yeah, go ahead.
I do want to ask a question, actually.
I wanna ask how you would, how you would make content that, uh, works and grabs attention
that's about the problems with attention economy.
How I would create content that helps with the, the problem?
Yeah, that content that speaks to the issue of the attention economy, but it's also attention-grabs-economy.
Yeah, so actually I, I have a friend working on, uh, something interesting, um, that's like, uh, an app that helps you, like,
It's like one of those screen time apps.
So I think that to grab people's attention
about that issue, you would do the exact same things
I just talked about, and then you would present
that as a problem.
But yeah, I don't think it changes the dynamic.
Like, the thing is you can't create a viral video
about how people are suffering from the fact
that there is so much dopamine,
like they're getting so much dopamine from watching videos
without following these principles
because no one's gonna watch it.
Like no one gives a shit about the tension economy.
Like no one cares unless you make it engaging.
I'm being serious.
Like do you think if I started a video off,
like unless it was really smart video,
maybe I started a video off and it says something like,
you're not gonna watch this video
because you're obsessed with your TikTok page.
Like that triggers someone.
But then that follows my principles.
It's like it's a strong hook.
It triggers someone to ask questions.
Like, so, so you, like, so how are you doing it?
How are you presenting it?
If you're gonna start the video off saying,
do you know 30% of teenagers struggle with, like,
who's gonna watch that, dude?
Like, like, it's boring.
So, yeah, I don't know, I'm going on a little rant here,
but I'm also just trying to make this engaging.
I'm not actually like this, this, this triggered,
But yeah, hope that answers your question.
Yeah, cool, cool.
Anything else before we wrap up?
Oh, go ahead.
What do you think about, like,
I guess this isn't really as related to what you do,
but like faceless accounts in general,
I find that pretty interesting,
and especially as we get like better sort of ways
to create videos at scale,
especially in like particular niches, right?
Let's say like travel or like education, you know,
like sports, like these sort of niches,
I think there's a lot of like,
you can kind of farm views
with these kind of faceless accounts.
Yeah, totally.
I mean, I think faceless accounts
are gonna be more so the case.
Like they're gonna emerge even more.
Dude, what's really interesting is like,
the fact that this is happening right now.
There are accounts where you go on Instagram
and there's no one's face, there's no one's voice.
And they're getting views.
Why?
Because they're using, like for example,
like 11 Labs voice model,
or they're like training a voice on someone,
like maybe some celebrity's voice,
which legally speaking, there's some legal things
to be careful there with.
They're training their model on some creator's voice,
and they're using that person to read a script.
So what I mean is, they just have someone read a script,
and then they take the voice from the script
that they feed them, they take a video
that could be AI generated or just stock footage
they find online and then they post the video
and that could go viral.
So like you can create video without even yourself
being in it, that's been here.
That'll only be more of the case as AI gets even more
sophisticated and things.
And obviously there'll be, I think the future
of content creation will be like largely just AI generated.
But before you start telling me I shouldn't create content
because AI will do it, absolutely not, terrible excuse.
Why?
Because not everyone wants to watch AI-generated content,
but that's not the main reason.
The main reason is content is gonna be enhanced by AI.
Dude, think about what I could do
if I had Steve Jobs clone right here as a result of AI.
Think about the content that I could create.
It's actually insane.
So I'm more excited about the fact that AI
is gonna enhance my content creation process
by 10x fold, like 100x fold.
the scripts, the video concepts.
That's already the case.
I can use ChatGPT for a lot of my videos and the scripts.
So that's one thing that I think is really fascinating.
And I would say instead of thinking to yourself,
oh, AI is just gonna create content
and we don't even have to worry about that,
is like, no, AI is gonna enhance the process
and help you create insanely cool content.
So I went on a little tangent there,
but I feel like that's important to mention here
since we are talking about content as well.
Go ahead.
in the same light, I mean, it seems like it's worth,
as you're experimenting, diving into the realm
of tools that exist to help you optimize
production as a content creator. Sorry, say your last question.
I said to help you optimize production as a content creator.
Sorry, is this a question? Like what tools?
No, it was more so in conjunction
with what you just said.
It's reasonable to, like, as you're experimenting
with your content creation.
Yeah, to experiment with different tools?
Yeah, to experiment with AI tools
and aims to optimize your production as a content creator.
Yeah, 100%, 100%, yeah.
And there's, like, tons of ways you can experiment with it.
In fact, I think that the future is, like,
you might find a style of content
that is largely based off a specific tool,
like an AI tool, and that just works.
So for example, gosh, I forgot his name,
Subesh, I think, he was creating this,
he was in the build space as well,
he was creating this website where you could just
create these fake videos of celebrities saying things.
I think there's a lot of legal troubles around that.
But I was thinking to myself,
dude, there's so many videos I could do
where I could just take a video of Peter Thiel
saying something and then pretend like he's on a Zoom meeting with me and I'm talking to him.
There's tons of videos I could do around that.
So that in itself would be a whole style of video that you can do just because of these AI tools.
And I think they're only going to get more and more sophisticated.
So yeah.
Any last questions?
Cool.
Nice. Thank you guys for your attention.
We're all going to go viral, that's what I want to hear.
