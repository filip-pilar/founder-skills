You all came here with the same goal.
And assuming that hasn't changed, it was to figure out how to go full-time on your idea.
And, you know, my feeling is, from what I've seen, some of you will figure that out within
this very short 11-week window we call SF2, which, when you think about it, is four weeks
less than a single college semester.
But most of you will likely figure it out after you leave.
And it might be six months, it might be nine months, it might be a year.
And I have no doubt that all of you will figure it out.
If you don't give up on your goal, I'm not just saying that.
But of course, it won't just happen by itself.
It's not like this automatic process where you will succeed.
You'll have to take certain actions.
And right now, you're all just learning a lot of things.
You're learning about how to focus, how to ask for help, how to find your true fans,
how to sell authentically.
This is what we learn here.
And you're learning far more than all of that subconsciously as you go through this process.
But if I could pick only one thing that separates all of you from your goals, it would be this.
good decisions. So that's what we're going to talk about. And if you haven't noticed by now,
I'm here to help you do that. And so is the rest of the team. And God willing, we're just a one
plus buff to your decision making abilities while you're here. But since we like, you know,
teaching people how to fish, so they're not just reliant upon us, I'm going to teach you
eight principles to help you make better decisions on your own.
So in the early days of building, your decisions actually don't matter that much.
You know, do I post my videos to Instagram or TikTok? I think everyone has had, you know,
asked me that question at some point. Do I sell to businesses or consumers? Seems like a very
significant decision, but when you're first starting out, maybe it doesn't matter that much.
and do I spend $100 on an influencer post?
The answer is usually going to be the same.
It's just pick one.
Because the main thing when you're starting out
is to just take action and gain momentum,
not make great decisions.
But the thing that does matter at any stage of what you're doing
is that internal process you have to make those decisions.
And, you know, I feel like if you agonized over any of the decision examples I just gave you, like currently, your decision-making process probably needs work.
And if you just picked a decision because you realized it didn't matter that much, then your process is likely pretty good.
And this process is the thing that needs to be sharpened and honed probably over your entire life, but this is the thing that really matters.
And so I thought about this for a while, and I thought of a simple way to think about it.
And it's kind of this three-step process.
You first gather data, then you apply your judgment, and then you make a decision.
So put another way, you read the menu, you see what sounds good, and then you order it.
So all I want to focus on though is the see what sounds good part because that's where
the majority of your energy is probably being spent.
And I call that judgment.
And so to me, judgment is this lens we see data through to make decisions.
If you've ever seen me make a pour over in the kitchen, I will taste it like I'm drinking
wine and then I'll be like thinking, you know, what is wrong with this? I'm judging the hell out
of the coffee and then, you know, think about how do I adjust that next time. And yeah, that judgment
is just the precursor to good decisions. Judgment tells you if you should hire the intern or not
hire the intern. Judgment tells you which track to pick for your reel that'll make people weep.
Judgment tells you if you should say yes to DJing that 200 person event even though you've never done it before.
And to illustrate the value of good judgment, do you ever wonder why some CEOs get paid millions of dollars to work less hard than you do right now?
And, you know, they're paid that much for a very good reason.
It's for their sound judgment, ideally, to make good decisions on behalf of a lot of
people.
Same with artists.
They get paid millions sometimes to simply make what they think people want.
So objectively, I think good judgment is the most valuable trait in the world.
All right, which brings me to my first principle.
When the long-term is unclear, just make good short-term decisions.
So I'm going to follow these up with examples from all of you.
Example, Declan and Derek, right?
Declan and Derek, building an AI study app, essentially.
They got off to a very strong start, making 20, 25K.
but they had this problem.
We don't know where this company is going over the next year.
So what should we do today?
And, you know, that's a very reasonable question.
If you don't know where things are going,
how do you even make, like, simple daily decisions?
I'm curious what, like, all of you think.
What would you say to Declan and Derek?
Adam, what would you say?
Good short-term decisions.
Okay, so what would you say in that case?
Like, look at what are some of the easiest first steps you can make based on what you've learned and also what you want to try and do.
Okay.
Yeah, Bronson.
Maintain what you have to buy yourself time.
Yeah, cool.
Yeah, yeah.
Do people who are using it right now, do they like it?
Asking if they like it, yeah.
Yeah.
Can you ask if you want to look at this for the next few weeks or something?
Right.
If you have it, then we'll open the next one month.
Right.
Okay.
So, went for a little walk around the pier as we do.
And I kind of said, do whatever improves your numbers now.
No matter what you decide later, that will only be good.
So, that's just applying short-term thinking.
And that is never going to be a bad idea.
You've just continued to improve things.
If you sell the business one day, your numbers will be better.
If you decide to just keep running it, that'll also be good.
This is just a very simple way to frame that problem.
Let's give an example of Adam.
He said the other day, should I just focus on making content or find a tech pivot and
raise money?
So it's a really good question.
You could make a dramatic change right now and just totally affect the trajectory of
what you're doing. And you know what I said was like either way you need
traction, right? Like focus on getting traction in the best way in the best way
you know how and you can come back to that decision later, right? So yeah if
you ever just get caught like in this you know you have no idea where things are
going there's always something you can do that no matter where this thing leads
it will just be helpful to you.
And I think BuildSpace is another really good example from pretty recently.
You know, this really happened.
The Dubai government is offering us millions of dollars over three years to run a campus.
Should we take the money?
And, you know, I think, I actually think most people would just say yes.
That was actually something we were trying to do.
It worked.
And then, you know, the deal came through and, you know, we decided, you know, not to do it.
And there was actually a really good reason for this.
reason for this. It was this. It was, you know, we've pivoted an insane amount over the last three
years. Chances are that will continue. Best to not commit to something that, you know, is almost
as long as the company has been around right now, right? So, you know, it's just like, it's just
interesting how like something that feels like success as well can also be like the wrong,
wrong decision and you know we trust farza to make make calls like that all right principle two
um i think this is like framed in a lot of like similar ways like pros and cons you know it's a
very simple way to kind of to say the same thing but i'm gonna i'm gonna point out like a slight
difference. So quickly weigh potential upside versus downside. I'll give an example of Kat.
So Kat was asking me this the other day. Should I DJ this party for Brian Johnson? Does everyone
know who Brian Johnson is by now? Cool. So I'm not that good at DJing yet, and I might embarrass
build space, which to me I kind of like laughed at. Like you definitely don't need to worry.
This is a very real concern for her though, right? So like what what would what would you say to Kat?
You know, she's she's brought this this concern
How would you kind of approach it?
I
So the pros and cons.
The pros, probably a lot of people get to know you.
Cons, you're just a little bit embarrassing.
You have an embarrassing moment, an awful moment.
I feel like, yeah, nobody likes to be embarrassed,
but that's not as bad as the good.
The good is more than the bad, you know what I mean?
Right.
If it goes well, then it's very well.
If the good is bad, I'll give you that.
Right.
I'd say like we're usually most our own harshest critics and the things you're embarrassed about
other people probably don't even think about.
Yeah, right.
Yeah, I'm just agreeing with Lucas.
Like if I think about the times in the past when I thought, oh, don't do this because
it will be embarrassing, every single time I was just being over, I was just overthinking
it.
Right.
So, you know, I like the idea of pros and cons.
The only thing that, you know, I think is like slightly different in this is that pros
and cons seem very concrete.
Like this is the pro, this is the con.
You don't really know what's going to happen.
So like the way I kind of think about it is like what's like best case scenario and like
what's worst case scenario and it's just more of a guess.
It's just upside versus downside risk basically.
And so yeah, you said a lot of those same things.
So upside, you know, pushes her comfort zone.
She gets to network a bit.
She gets feedback on her work.
And, you know, she gets to see if she likes DJing in person.
Downside, potential embarrassment, right?
So, you know, after this, what I said to her was, it's an ideal fit.
Trust me.
Now, do I know it's an ideal fit?
Absolutely not.
But for me, I'm just doing this, like, quick analysis in my head, upside versus downside.
and maybe she just needs like a little bit of confidence
and it's just like, just go for it.
So that's kind of how I looked at that situation.
Kareem, here's another example.
So Kareem was, you know, he had a food truck catering business.
It was doing pretty well.
And, you know, now he's thinking about like another business
that he's worked a bit on.
So he said, should I stop selling food truck services,
which are kind of working,
and pivot to selling foot traffic data, right?
So like, how would you like approach that problem?
You know, it's a big question.
It's a huge decision.
Yeah.
Which one is more exciting?
Which one is more exciting, yeah.
What if like food truck services is working extremely well,
but it's like, you know, it's kind of boring,
but selling foot traffic data is like at zero?
So would you say kind of go after what's most exciting?
Yeah, obviously.
Okay.
Obviously, yeah.
Yeah?
I would say if the future services go in and just keep doing that,
maybe split it like 60-40 until there's enough scale for that.
Okay, okay.
So, you know, upside, larger market, better margins.
It's already validated, and you get to feel excited again.
Downside, don't really know much about it.
Right, so although it was like a significant decision if you just like think about it upside versus downside
You know, I was just kind of like just go for it
And you know, it's a it's important to like
Challenge these things like if someone has that clear decision
It's good to challenge yourself challenge other people
But if you just do some like kind of yeah, just basic basic just checks
You know it actually can become like kind of obvious even though it's a significant decision
yeah any questions on that that was pretty straightforward all right so principle three
if your decision is emotional don't pretend it's logical
and so getting to some examples so example many many of you here actually
you know I've heard this heard this a lot should I keep doing what's working or try and monetize
my audience, raise money, sell my business, etc. And you know there's one way to look at this which
is you know just rationalizing and I've heard this a lot actually over the last week. Like I
need to make a bold move to progress and now is the time. Reality it might be just the grind is
boring and I'm getting impatient and you know it's really important to kind of like check yourself to
see what is the reality. And you know the main thing is just don't pretend, right?
Like it's very important to know why you're making a decision. And it's
completely fine to make an emotional decision. No one's saying that's the
wrong thing to do. But the idea is you just know exactly why you're doing that
thing. So you know also if your decision to take that bold move works out that's
That's really great.
Impatience served you.
If not, at least you know next time it was actually your impatience that messed you up.
So just be honest.
So regardless of how it goes, you should know why you did that thing.
And example is just me a lot over the years as well.
This is something I asked myself in the last 20 years of trying to be an entrepreneur.
Should I keep pushing or just quit and do something better?
And I can rationalize it as I'm not progressing, so I have to change something.
Reality is sometimes I just need a break.
I just need to take two days off, and then I'm actually completely fine.
So it's just kind of a learning about yourself,
learning, just becoming aware of how you're making those choices.
And that's kind of it.
But the main thing is just admit it's emotional
so you can learn what's informing your choices
because that's the thing that really matters.
Any questions?
Is there any good way to tell like what it is?
Like if you need a break or you should, you know,
get some questions?
Yeah, I think sometimes like for me personally,
I'll, you know, taking a break is not a hard thing to do, to check.
Like if I'm going to make like a very significant decision,
I'll probably just take a little more time with it
and I'll just be more skeptical of it.
There is a time though when I would just do the complete opposite.
do the complete opposite. I was just like, as soon as I felt that thing, I would just do that thing.
But I think, you know, over time you just kind of learn about yourself. But, you know, when it's a
significant decision, just ask, just check. Like maybe this is just something where you just need
to take a break. Are you being objective? You can talk to other people about it.
it.
Sorry?
Should you wait for some decision to feel natural to you or should you be time bound
and make a decision at that point in time?
I think what's good to do, like depending on how significant the decision is, you would
just allot more time to that thing.
And I think the other thing is, if it keeps coming up, if that decision just keeps coming
up, there's probably something you need to do about it.
It's not just, hey, I'll just take a break and then I'll never feel that way again.
Maybe it's like, I'll take a break and then I'll need to take another break and it just
keeps coming up.
Well it's probably like a pattern and you probably need to change something at that
point where the breaks don't really add up to anything.
Anybody else?
Anybody else?
Question.
So what about like a thing that some people feel like all of your guts, but sometimes
you just feel like something is the decision to take, but you don't really know what.
It's kind of an internal feeling you don't take up basically.
Yeah.
Do you think that's a good thing to do and like does this stand to maybe have a pattern
that can be more like an important decision?
Yeah, I just think it still like just depends on like the gravity of that decision.
You know, if it's like ordering at a restaurant, you probably don't need to agonize over the
decision.
You can just kind of go with your gut.
You're like, I just feel like that thing.
But if it's like something that could affect you for years or it's like quitting a job,
quitting what you're doing, you should probably give it like a little more time, right?
Like that's probably how it I'd answer it in probably the same way.
Yeah.
Does that make sense?
Anybody else?
Okay, principle four.
When in doubt, just do the math.
Example, Mihir and Kiran.
So if you don't know what Mihir and Kiran are doing, they're working on like a B2B cloud services person,
how would you actually describe your thing in one line?
I still can't do it.
How to manage cloud using code.
Right.
Okay.
So, you know, in the last week, they came up with another possible opportunity.
Through exploring this, they thought of another idea.
And they asked, hey, is it worth, like, pursuing that new idea?
And, you know, my answer was just kind of like, make a spreadsheet, you know?
Enter how many people you think would want this, how much they would pay,
how much it would cost to deliver that to them all how many you can realistically deliver on
x time frame like you can start putting numbers to these ideas and you know even if it's like
totally off one it's like an exercise and like trying to be objective and like trying to approach
things like mathematically and the other thing is like hey maybe it'll actually be useful and
you can tell is this a fifty thousand dollar idea is it a ten million dollar idea you just don't
know. And so we do this all the time here. You know, we have like 100 business models we've come
up with over the last year. We put some numbers to them and you can just roughly see, you know,
hey, should we do merch? Okay, well, we know how much merch we can sell. We know the margins,
we know how many people, all this stuff. We know what it takes to deliver it, how many people,
all this stuff you can just put and just run the math on and see if it makes sense.
And so, you know, you can do that very quickly. Like we've done that with like 100 ideas.
You can do this in like five to ten minutes.
So if you're just not sure, you know, is this worth your time?
You can just do something like that.
Has anyone ever like tried to do something like that?
No one is down to math.
Okay.
Wow.
Yeah.
Okay, cool.
Is anyone like wondering if their business makes sense or what they're working on makes
sense?
Yeah.
You're wondering?
Cool. Yeah?
I'm wondering how much you should be thinking about that projection while you're still creating.
Yeah. I think you can give these things a bit of time. I guess you just don't know entirely,
but it's good to have some guess, like ideal scenario, worst case scenario. You can plot
both of those out and you can just see like you know is this even worth
attempting in this way or maybe it'll give you some ideas for how you should
approach it and yeah so like you know in the example of like merchant build space
we can run the math on that very quickly and learn like this will probably not be
a significant business model in like five to ten minutes right so that can
really like inform like how you spend your time in like a relatively short
amount of time.
Kat, where are you?
Does that make sense?
Cool.
Ryan.
So Ryan is building a clothing brand, which is, I'd say, one of the harder businesses
you can build.
And he said, I've made 1K net so far.
How do I make 4K more this month?
How would you guys approach that?
What would you say to Ryan here?
Michael?
I'd probably just be like, grab a spreadsheet and figure out how much it costs to make your
things and how many you need to sell to get to that number.
Or like how you change your prices or change your strategy to get that goal.
Yeah, right.
Okay.
Yeah?

I would like to use like $40.
You would what?
I would approach like 4K in a month.
Why not?
How I made one day and how can I double it?
That would make more sense rather than approaching like make it four times, which is very hard.
Okay, what if he absolutely had to, you know?
Yeah, maybe like look at other streams where we can make business or make probably a coaching run.
like make more articles probably that better.
Okay, yeah.
I think like from like how we made this first one,
it was just like within a few minutes like over here.
I think that's the most of the distinction.
So I would just say that I just do that again,
like some other place, like maybe Farmers Inc. or something.
Like somewhere else where you just get like 20 people,
say a story in a minute and then just do the same thing.
It should be like three times, four times.
Right. So like, yeah, repeat the thing that you feel worked.
worked. I guess my question then would be like, how do you know if it worked? Was that good enough?
Did you, was that like the perfect way to make a thousand dollars or was it kind of like a messy way
to make a thousand dollars and it could be better, right? Kieran. I think something that hasn't been
you mentioned is the delivery aspect.
Like, how long did it take him to deliver one unit?
Right.
And so then how many units can he actually deliver in a month?
And then work backwards from there?
Yeah.
Because if he can't deliver more than X number of units,
either he has to figure out how to get two more units,
or he has to figure out a different pricing track.
Yeah, so, you know, kind of I said something similar.
You know, you could just do the math on that.
You need to make $4,000, $25 per shirt, so you better sell 160 shirts.
Or you could, you know, change up the product and you can do $4,000 at $500 per leather jacket
and just sell like eight jackets in a month, right?
So you got to look at, you know, a lot of things.
You got to look at your current audience size, how much you can grow that,
how many people you can sell a $24 shirt to versus like a $500 jacket.
You know, can you, you know, what is the amount of time to make 160 shirts versus eight jackets
in one month? Like there's a lot of things you have to think about. But I think if you kind of
attempt that exercise, it'll probably point you in the right direction. And my feeling is it's
probably something like selling eight jackets in a month seems like a more realistic way to get to
that goal versus just the amount of time it would take to do shirts.
So it just helps you also to stand back from what you're doing and just see, hey, is there
another way I can do this?
If I just up the price here, what does that mean?
Yeah?
So it seems like the timeboxing is a really important part of this exercise.
How did you approach the timeboxes?
Yeah, I think you'd have to like literally look at how much time you have to spend on this.
How much time you have to spend on like making stuff, selling it.
Could you make a jacket in like five hours or does it take like 40 hours?
You know, this would be like a very big question.
Yeah, so I think that's a good way to put it.
Like you can set the parameters on any of these things.
You can set the time, you can set the price, all this stuff and work backwards from there.
And even though it's not like guaranteed, at least the math like checks out.
you can get there and that's the theory, right?
Okay, principle five.
Deciding to do more than one thing at a time will likely result in failure.
I have a little caveat to this.
I would say like if you have momentum, if you have a team, maybe you can do this.
But even generally here, we try and avoid these things.
So, some examples, I've heard this one, I'll make music while making a film, I'll focus
on selling while trying to raise money, I'll make content while monetizing it, I'll build
a business while I become an artist.
And what would you, how do you guys react to this principle in general?
What's that?
No one specific.
What's like initial reaction to like, you know, someone saying this to you?
Yeah, right.
It's really hard.
Why is it hard?
It's hard to do two things at once?
Yeah.
Right.
Okay.
Has anyone tried to do like two things at once or still trying to do two things at once?
Okay. And why do you think that is? Maybe me here. Why are you trying to do two things at once?
And what are those two things?
Oh, one is the cloud thing, and the other thing is working on coding models.
It's me and Kiran mostly working on it, but we do end up splitting our attention.
Right.
Okay. Yeah, Adam.
I think it's hard to put your heart into two things at once.
Okay.
You could do a mindless job, kind of, and then put your heart in something, but it's
hard to try to do two really actively important projects at once.
Okay.
So you all kind of agree that doing two things at once is actually not ideal?
That's good.
I have.
Yeah.
I feel like this is pretty personal, but I try to dodge between things because I personally
find it boring after a while to like keep doing the same thing and i feel like switching between
creative things also it's like if i'm stuck on making this song i just end up starting another
project or like start like working on my film more so until i find the creative inspiration
for my song and that just feels more like a natural process to me than just committing to
this one idea and just trying to...
Okay, yeah. So, you know, for you, like, you have to do something completely different,
but that's still, like, productive. So what are those two things for you? Or, like, you
know, you're making music, you know, you don't have the inspiration to keep making
music, you know, what's the other thing you do?
So there are two scenarios. One is, like, I'm working on a song, and I'm not finding
inspiration, I start working on another song. Another aspect is, like, I'm working on a
song, I'll instead like end up writing, working on my script more for like a few days and
then I'll come back to that song.
And do you find like doing the scripting like helps you just make music later?
Or is that like a break?
Or like I guess where does the scripting go to?
Does that like, you know, is that...
It's a break and it's a break when I, it's a break and I also don't feel unproductive
about it.
Right, okay. So, and how is the scripting going?
Scripting is going decent. It's not like I don't have the same momentum as I have with music
right now, but it's still moving at a linear pace. Okay, yeah. Yeah, I think the main thing is
the other stuff you're doing, how is that helping the primary thing you're doing? Maybe that is just
just like a break, it's a way to get inspiration.
Like I still think that's like a focused way
to work on something.
So, you know, it sounds like you're doing two things at once
but maybe not.
Maybe that's just how you find inspiration
or get through difficult times with the other thing.
So, you know, my feeling is, you know,
when you're faced with these two like very difficult
challenges at once, I feel like you should just pick one
or, you know, you risk masking like indecisiveness.
Like you're like, should I make music or make a film?
I'll just do both.
Well, maybe it's just because you just can't pick one
or you just lack conviction in what you're doing.
And so I think you should just force yourself.
You had to pick one.
What would you pick?
And that'll at least tell you maybe, hey,
this is probably the thing that really matters.
And so, yeah, I usually find that it's going to be one
of these two things.
Yeah?
What about building a startup and building an audience?
Those are different things of course related
because building a whole system of your startup as well.
Yeah.
But there's some awesome things at the end,
but they're still important at the same time.
Yeah, I think like, you know,
I see those both as like building your startup.
Like it's still all towards like the same goal.
I think when it's different is just like,
when it's just like these significant,
like very significant things.
It's like, yeah, you know, building, yeah,
Building your career as an artist, building a business.
At the same time, trying to monetize audience growth.
Like these are just both very large things.
They're both super hard.
So yeah, what I said was kind of like doing one of these things
is hard enough, and you need every advantage
you can possibly get.
Does that make sense?
Cool.
Alright.
Alright, principle six.
I think about this like maybe the most of anybody I know so far.
But time is a form of currency and I think you should treat it as like an investment in your decisions.
So for example, you can spend 60 hours of work time per week in many ways, as you know.
know. You can spend it building, launching, selling, networking, eating, making pour-overs,
napping, chatting, procrastinating, etc. There's lots of ways to break down 60 hours. And you
can drill down further into any of these categories too. You can spend 30 hours building one core
feature or 15 hours building an extra feature and then 15 hours like
fixing bugs. And you know each of these things will have outputs roughly
proportional to your time investment. And I just think in general like treat time
as like a precious non-renewable resource. You know every time you decide
to do something, just, yeah?
That's good, yeah?
Oh, okay, okay.
I think, you know, before you attempt anything,
if it takes a small amount of time, then sure,
like it's an easier decision.
If it's something like that's going to really impact
what you're doing, you know, the time is actually
very, very, very precious.
Just like curious, like,
who here like feels like they really think about
like their time they spend on their, you know,
every action they take.
OK, you really analyze, is this worth two hours, three hours,
a day?
Yeah?
Cool.
Do you find it helps you?
I find that it's doing the math.
I think that we probably haven't valued our time.
Despite doing the math, I don't think
we valued our time enough to make good decisions around it.
And so even though we do say, oh, hey,
this might take this long, right,
when we decide whether or not to do something,
if that estimate is inaccurate, which for our project
that we've been working on has been,
it still feels like a waste of time.
Right.
So I believe that accurate estimate also, I think,
is important.
It's interesting because I'm not usually like this, but in the last few weeks or months
I've gotten really busy with a bunch of things here and outside of it.
And I've started to think this way a lot more, or even like 30 minutes is important to me
generally.
So it's interesting that I'm not usually like it, but now that I'm busier, I'm more mindful
of time.
Yeah.
Like personally, I'm probably at like the five minutes matters.
I don't know if you guys notice that in my conversations with some of you sometimes,
But it's just, yeah, the time to me is like crazy precious.
Yeah, hey, Bill.
Yeah, also, I think, because I've worked as a contractor before,
you're like, time is equal to one, basically.
Right, yeah.
And I think that makes it very easy to see like an hour,
it's like $100, so when you're doing nonsense,
you're kind of like, it's easier to visualize.
Sure, yeah.
Yeah, Adam.
I find it's like, it'd be really hard, though,
if you have a certain mind and time fluctuates in its value,
like one hour can not be very useless or can be very useful.
I find lately I have become more tight,
but it's been more about energy levels than time.
Like how much energy, like this hour being able to take this much energy,
do I have that to spare that day?
So I've just, I've personally just been feeling more like the energies
than the thing I'm resource-time balancing versus time,
but I can see timing.
Time to take a break.
Yeah, I get that.
Yeah?
I think also for me, the value of the time
is also contextual.
One hour means a lot, but right now,
the most valuable thing I could be doing in this hour
is sitting here listening versus doing some other work.
So also time, but also in the context of at this moment
in time, what could you be doing that is most valuable?
Yeah.
Yeah, it's a very weird concept in that way.
But it's almost like, how would you like to spend your time and how can you maximize the
way you spend your time is something I think about.
Principle 7.
This is something I also do a lot.
I just assign probabilities to better way decisions.
For example, you can spend 40 hours a week working a job and you'll have 100% odds of
making 100K in a year because you're paid a salary.
Or you can spend 60 hours a week painting art and maybe you have 50% odds of making
30K in one year because painting art and selling it is just generally hard.
Not to say you can't exceed that, it is just tougher.
Or you can spend 80 hours a week building an AI startup and maybe you have 10% odds
of making $10 million in like five years.
So when you're weighing these things,
it's really important to just think about
the probability of those outcomes.
And this is something you kind of learn
when you do sales as well.
So if there's a 10% chance of closing a 100K deal,
that's actually like 10K in forecast revenue.
You have to apply the odds of that happening.
Or there's like an 80% chance of closing a 20K deal.
That's actually worth more
because you have a much higher chance of closing that,
and that's how you kind of look at those sales too.
So I don't know if anyone's kind of doing sales pipelines and stuff like that,
but that just becomes second nature.
And that's a good way to do it.
How much is that worth?
What are the chances I can close that?
How much is the time spent in closing that?
You can always break it down in that way to see the true value of it.
Yeah, does anyone think in probabilities in general?
like when you're making a decision yeah I'm just curious
yeah for sure yeah okay just curious cool so yeah just in general like you can't just look at
potential outcomes you have to look at like the probability of those outcomes so that's just like
a simple way you can now like layer that on top like you have like hey this could go really well
What are the chances it could go really well?
Or this could go really bad.
What are the chances it could go really bad?
Yeah?
How can I raise the probability of me
earning a particular amount of money by next year?
I mean, all of these things are kind of made up, right?
But it's more just to help inform your decision making.
Like, you've already decided, hey, I'm
going to be an artist.
And this is the amount of money I could make as an artist,
theoretically.
And I have these odds.
maybe roughly, you've done the math in some way and you've decided to do it, right? Now it's like,
hey, how can I like actually increase my odds of that thing happening? What are like the actions
you can take? Whether that's like making more music or just like, you know, collaborating more,
whatever it is, you know, you can start to increase like the probability of that thing happening.
But in a way you've already chosen to do that thing, right?
But anyway, the idea is more like you know what possible outcomes there are.
Just know that there's this other way to improve how you look at the chances of those outcomes
happening.
Any questions on that?
Yeah?
So once you know the solution, how do you decide whether it's worth it to you?
Yeah, I mean, you just have, yeah.
I'm just going to say, like, for the start,
but it's like quite a lot of business,
but then the payout comes really high.
Yeah.
It's like, how do you inject that information?
Yeah, I mean, all these things get kind of personal.
It's just, you know, what's your risk tolerance?
Do you feel like, you know, you might be able to, like,
overcome those odds?
You know, it's more like, you know,
how can you be, like, objective about these things
that are just like really confusing to think about,
very chaotic to think about,
and just being kind of aware of those things.
Yeah.
Right, exactly, yeah.
Yeah, exactly.
I think that's a really good way to look at it.
you're kind of looking at it amongst other things.
Right, like what are the odds of this
versus that versus that versus that.
And that just helps you just put it in,
put it into context, right?
Yeah, Abel.
How do you come up with that
probability to assign?
It's just kind of like,
I think a lot of these things are just like guesswork, right?
But you know, I guess it helps you put like some kind of like,
puts you in like some kind of frame of mind
to like evaluate these things.
And just go into it with like kind of eyes wide open
And if you have to make a decision,
at least you have some data point.
In terms of, let's say, sales, right?
You can assign that probability.
The probability is a total guess.
It's like how conversations are going.
How fast are they responding to emails?
It's just made up, right?
But it just helps you just put things into perspective,
I think.
Yeah?
One thing that helps me to make sense of payout
is think of it in terms of orders of 10.
Because I was thinking way too much.
and then I was like, okay, maybe this has like a $100 market
or a $100 market or a $200 market or a $200 market.
So how would I, I don't know.
Right, right, right, yeah, exactly.
So you can just keep it simple.
It is all, again, it is like made up.
It's just more like, and you know,
I kind of mentioned at the beginning,
it's just your decision making process
and just kind of trying to refine that
using some kind of objective way of doing it,
even if it's kind of made up.
Yeah.
Okay, last principle.
You'll never know what was a good or bad decision until much later.
This is just the reality.
A good short-term result can come from a bad long-term decision, and a bad short-term result
can come from a good long-term decision.
And if you really think about it, I think we all know this to be true.
So, you know, life is complex.
All you can do is aim to learn and improve
as much and as fast as possible
and use whatever principles you've learned
and take your best guess.
And that's it.
Any questions?
Oh, yeah.
Can you give an example of a decision that had a long-term success or a short-term mistake?
Short-term mistake.
It's more like something that seems to go badly in the short-term can come from a good
long-term decision.
So maybe like a simple one that maybe you all understand is like leaving a job.
Okay.
Well, you know, your pay is going to be severely affected.
You just lost your source of income, but in the long run, you know, that was probably a good decision.
You just don't know if it was good to leave your job until much later.
You just have no idea. Maybe that job was actually great and the thing you did didn't work out well, you know.
But then maybe three years later it goes well. You just don't know, right?
So, you know, I think my only point is like you can use all these tools, use all these principles.
At the end of the day, it is just guessing, but you're trying to trying your best to take like informed guesses.
Put some, just add some order to the chaos of the guesses.
And that's kind of it.
That's all you can do.
Yeah?
How do you make, how do you decide when to chill?
When to chill?
Yeah, that's why I understand stuff.
Yeah, that's funny.
How do you decide when to chill?
And how do you like, cut off the mood?
Wow.
During the weekend, this project, I try to like, to chill.
I feel like these are very like for me personally like I separate almost like
You know working indoors from like being out in nature if I'm like out in nature
I'm clearly like there's no way I can work. I'm just like totally disconnected from technology and
Business and all this stuff like that's just very for me personally
I think segregate something is very important.
Yeah?
When I go home, I leave my laptop here,
but there's no way I can actually work.
Yeah, I do the exact same thing.
Oh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean, I will work at home, but it's not quite the same.
Something that works for some people is turning off their phones.
Yeah, turning off your phones.
It's a lot.
Yeah, get the block.
It's actually just a big ad for block.
Get block.com.
Wow.
Yeah.
Buy the blog.
Um, yeah, cat.
All right, shh, cat.
How much do you control other people for your opinion of feedback or your opinion of your
role?
I'm quite bad at this.
I'm learning to get better.
Actually, Farza always tells me to do this more.
And yeah, I think it's just a habit you build.
I mean, the thing for me sometimes is like, I'll probably just go off on some tangent
on my own and then I'll kind of like just check it and then know that you know if I
get some kind of feedback here or whatever I'll just you know maybe I'll make a small
adjustment I'll like try and do something with it that like still makes sense to me
where I still like you know still adds up to the thing that I feel is good or works.
Yeah.
Yeah like I like I again I think I'm a bad example of someone who's good at this.
like I have to force myself to like ask for people's opinions on stuff. I do think it's good
like that's but I think like the main thing is like it's not like how much feedback you get
it's like what you do with that and for me it's like I'll try and like implement some minor things
or there's a good Neil Gaiman quote that I'm going to try and paraphrase but it's basically
like when people tell you something is wrong,
they're almost always right.
When they tell you exactly what's wrong,
they're almost always wrong.
And I actually love that.
I think about that all the time.
So there's almost no harm in asking for feedback.
It's just more like how much time do you
want to spend on that?
Yeah.
Does that make sense?
Yeah.
Cool.
Anybody else?
Yeah.
Sure.
So you were saying essentially like the amount of effort that you put into considering a decision
should be proportional to the impact that it would.
Say that again?
So like you were saying that you should think more about decisions that will impact you more.
Right.
And think less about ones that will impact you less.
Like at a restaurant, you shouldn't really think about it.
Just go with your gut.
Not think more, but maybe take more time.
Yeah, like give it more time.
That may be not thinking about it for like days,
but not making like an impulsive decision
for something that's like significant.
So, following to that then is
if you make a decision with bad information
and you're just guessing and then you do the thing
and you gain some information about the thing
that you're doing, should you,
Like, how often should you reevaluate that decision?
That's completely, like, you know,
I don't think there's anything wrong with that.
I think it's just knowing, you know,
I don't know where that principle is buried,
but it's basically just being honest with yourself
about why you did that thing.
And if it turned out great, fantastic, you know?
But you just know why you did that thing.
And if it turned out to not go well,
then still, you've learned from, you know,
maybe I shouldn't be so impulsive in the future, you know?
Yeah, right.
This is more of a personal question I have, but how do you handle your work moving forward
in the next day if you get like a really poor night's sleep?
And I guess a follow up for that is like, if you have like four nights of sleep multiple
days, how do you approach the work?
They're turning into one ones.
I mean, personally, I just suffer through it and I just like try and fix that as soon
as possible.
Right.
Just get back on track.
That was like one time in the last three months.
That was a little bit of once.
Yeah.
Someone else?
Yeah.
One thing related to the other question about when to reach out for Flutter.
At least for me, what I do, at least try to do, always,
but I guess when I'm in a sort of crisis or I have a decision to take,
and then I'm like, you know, yeah, when I'm in crisis mode,
In crisis mode, I don't reach out immediately to people because I know I would probably
over-insaturate things and I'm not going to be able to explain well.
But of course I try to process myself right about it and ask me to get a lot more clarity.
Once I have that, I'm trying to get clarity, then I can do someone else and ask for help.
Because I think of course I'm not going to waste their time as much and then they're going to be able to help me with that.
So it's kind of forced processing yourself and then once you have more clarity, it works.
the same thing. Like I'll probably just like see if I can kind of get through it on my own,
but I also don't think that's like necessarily the right thing to do or something. You can just
go immediately to someone and that's like totally totally cool, right? But uh yeah, great.
When you're like evaluating outcomes of your decisions, how big of a path could you like
place on luck or like kind of like a chance? Does that make sense?
I mean, there's no like evaluating that. It's almost like just do the thing that's like the highest probability and
You know if luck is on your side then great and if it's not well, you know, you weren't expecting it anyway
So I do think luck does play like a huge part in things in general
But there's like no point like I don't know. I don't see the purpose of it
I did this, I got the clue.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And next time you go make a big advantage,
you're like, oh, well, it worked a lot of time.
Right.
Yeah, I think you have to be honest with yourself
if that was lucky.
I don't know.
I feel like personally I can tell if something just like,
there was a lucky break.
Or let's say I took something that was very high risk,
unlikely to work out, yet it went well.
Then I'll be like, oh, shit, I was just lucky.
And if you're not, then you're probably
going to lose that luck the second time you do it.
It's going to go back to zero, right?
Anything else?
Cool, thanks so much guys.
