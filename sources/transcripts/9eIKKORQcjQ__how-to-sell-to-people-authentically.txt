All right.
What's up everyone?
How's it going?
My heart rate is, for some reason,
20 beats above average right now.
Normally 47, but right now 66.
No idea what's going on, might be getting sick.
Let's see.
Cool, so today I wanna talk to you all about
selling your work authentically.
And I kinda wanna start, like I normally do,
with just a story to help kinda contextualize
of this. I don't really like just jumping into the skill. I don't know. I feel like we all learn
better from stories. So let's essentially cover a story that helped me figure this out for myself.
Right? This is... Anybody want to guess who this is? Yeah, it's my dad. Yes, this is my dad.
And he was rocking the Bill Space hoodie like a couple months ago and he dropped by for the first
for the first time to San Francisco.
And a couple things about my dad.
He was born in Pakistan, right?
So this is him.
He came to America in the early 90s,
looking like this.
My mom sent me this picture today, by the way.
I said, give me a picture of Papa
when he first came to America.
So I'd never seen this picture before.
But he came to America in the early 90s.
And you know, he was your classic kind of immigrant story.
Drove taxis, flip pizzas at Syrah Pizza.
And yeah, mostly drove taxis in New York City, Miami,
and then did a bunch of restaurant work, right?
In the late 90s, he got a job at Nissan.
So that's him right there on the right.
And he got a job selling cars at Nissan in Miami.
And over 25 years later, what's really interesting is
he now works at what is the most highest performance
dealership in the country, like in the top.
They don't actually, they don't have like
a number one rank or anything like that.
It's just like by percentage.
So he's one of the top percentages.
And he's ranked either number one in his region every year,
or, which they actually do rankings for these people,
it's pretty wild.
Or they do like, or he's top in his region
in terms of performance by percentage, right?
So pretty much, my dad is like a sales machine.
Like he's just so good at it, it's crazy.
And this is in the car business.
He has not left the car business for over 25 years.
This is actually a dealership.
When I was growing up, I worked at Toyota.
So during middle school, high school,
he worked here at Toyota.
And that's me, so 14 year old me
would be sitting at his office looking like this.
And you know, I would usually go to his office
because I would do homework there.
He'd pick me up from school and we'd go back
to his office sometimes.
And I loved his office because you'd have coffee,
popcorn, things like that, right?
And so I'd literally sit in his office, right?
Like, I'm like on the, his office is not that big.
It's maybe the size of that room actually.
And I have like a desk on the side.
and end up learning a lot from just listening to him
talk to customers for like years, right?
Just by me sitting on the side
and hearing him have these conversations.
And then what I learned is my dad
literally never tried to sell anything.
He was never trying to push a product on his customer.
He was never trying to be the sales guy, like ever.
Like you would rarely hear him talk about trying to like
sell an upgrade to the customer.
And again, these are people coming into Honda,
or in this case Toyota, buying a car, right?
So that's their intention.
And his goal is to one, get them to lock down the car,
but then to also do a bunch of other stuff,
which the dealership does,
to make more money on the customer, right?
And I think what's really interesting about my dad,
having, to this day I observe him,
I go to his dealership sometimes,
and he just really tries to understand
the person in front of him, you know what I mean?
He never really does anything else.
He just tries to understand them,
and at the end of some time period,
maybe 10, 20 minutes, he'll make them an offer, right?
something that he feels would be good for them
and also work for him.
That's kind of how he always operated.
And growing up in this dealership,
you start to compare with other people as well
because generally, if you're into a car dealership,
you can kind of just eavesdrop at any office.
Like you can walk around,
hear how different salespeople do their thing.
And I would do that actually.
I would be like, okay, what's my dad doing
and what are the other people doing?
And the other people gave me this sort of vibe
half the time.
It was actually kind of crazy.
They just gave me this sort of vibe.
And I think a lot of you guys know this sort of vibe.
It's like you're kind of like a used car salesperson, right?
Where they're just trying to like cut you a deal.
They're trying to like rope you into something,
you know, like lock you into something.
And they would say things like this,
hey, we have a package that gives you leather seats
for just $1,000 more.
Are you interested?
Right?
So I hear these phrases as a kid.
You know, the Honda Accord has a feature
It protects your blind spots for $2,000 more.
But hey, because you're here today, 25% off.
You know, things like that.
The new 2010 Camry is an amazing car.
It has these XYZ features that no one else offers.
This is the best car in its class,
and you should have this car.
And you know, generally,
these statements all have the same reply.
Does anyone have a guess what the kind of replies were?
No.
Yeah, I think you all know what an awkward type reply,
because you all have been pitched like this.
Oh interesting, I'll let you know, you know, cool.
Or awkward chuckle, ha ha, you know,
I think not right now, you know.
That sort of vibe, right?
And it almost felt like these salespeople
were delivering an IRL ad, like in person.
Like they were literally an ad, but as a human being.
It was interesting.
And turns out a lot of you are being this guy.
You are not being, my dad in this case,
you are actually being this guy,
whether you believe it or not right now,
you're kind of being this guy.
And there's some pros to being this guy,
but there's also a lot of cons to being this guy
at this stage.
And I know this because of last Friday's exam day.
15 projects, I actually counted,
15 projects were either flat or down, right?
So that means you either, the graph didn't move
or it went down, right?
And 11 projects were slightly up,
but it didn't feel like there was a push.
You know like, you guys come in on the final Friday,
you get like one person to check your thing out,
and then you say it went up?
It's sort of like that sort of vibe, you know?
Like, it's kind of like, oh, you kind of just like,
kind of just did something near the end
and you counted it as an up, but eh,
I kind of know the backstory, you know?
Like, you didn't actually, it wasn't actually a big push.
And I think two projects I had from last week,
at least I saw, I saw like there was a big leap,
like a really intentional big push
throughout the whole week, right?
And that was kind of interesting to me.
And this is when you break it down,
this is what it looks like, right?
Like red being, didn't move or down,
yellow being like a slight up and green being like,
it was like a legitimate push.
Now at the end of the day, the graph is like,
your graphs are only like one signal
to like me understanding what's going on in your life.
Like that's it.
So I wouldn't read into this too much right now.
Like I wouldn't, again, we'll talk about graphs later,
but again, for me it's one signal.
And it's a signal that helps me understand
that selling is not happening, right?
And what this means is 50% of you
made zero movement last week, right?
And to me, that is insane.
Like that is actually like,
That's crazy how that can actually happen.
And I don't think it's because of a lack of trying.
I don't think anyone here is being lazy.
I can't name a single person, to be honest.
You all are putting in a ton of effort.
You're trying new things, so then what gives?
Again, I see you're putting in effort, so what gives, right?
Can anybody maybe give me their thoughts?
Otherwise, it's just me roasting some of you.
Anyone give me your thoughts?
What's going on in your life?
What do you think is going on if you were someone that maybe didn't make big moves last week?
What's what gives yeah
Emotionally toiling week I get the up so those come yes
You spent a lot of our week debugging and you got stuck in this like focus on like let's fix this, let's fix this.
Yeah.
It's not like taking the step back and like okay, that's where we made a mistake.
A lot of your week spent debugging.
Let's do maybe one more.
Anybody have their thought, like honest thoughts?
What happened last week for them?
Ryan?
My commute is making it burn out.
Commute's tough, right?
I think at the end of the day what I'm kind of hearing is something along the lines of like maybe personal management or time management, right?
To me what the graphs show me like what this shows me is that SF2 has like a selling problem
They don't have enough they don't have a problem of like not putting in the work
They were problem with all any it's like a selling thing at the end of the graph shows me your ability to like sell the thing right so
That's what I think I think you have a selling problem and I think I
Talked to some of you even last week and I was kind of asked to ask you like hey
What gives you know end of Friday like what's going on it's been three weeks?
Why are you still at that same state?
And it's like, oh, far as what I got right now,
it's kind of crappy and unfinished.
It's not there yet, you know?
Like, I'm still working on it, right?
And I think the reality is truly is,
that will always be the answer.
That is still my answer to this day,
for what I work on today, you know?
And I think it's really like,
it's always going to be crappy and unfinished.
I think a lot of people think Facebook as a company
is still crappy and unfinished.
You know what I mean?
So everyone's always going to be feeling like
something's not right.
So that's the reality, right?
Right, this is like a very sad reality that I realized like many years ago now
But it's always gonna be crappy unfinished. So what do you do? Right? And I think I also thought about this
Earlier today, which is I feel like all of you actually do have something like every single one of you has like something in the sense of like
You have a thing and you can describe it and you can show it you can do all these things
So no matter how early you are how crappy you think your thing is in my eyes all of you have something
So now what do you do right? You have to make it better by either one improving your own skills improving your craft
Right as an engineer designer, whatever you are and then two by selling
And I think one thing that people get tripped up on when it comes to selling
I'll talk about what I mean by selling in a bit is
You don't have to pretend like you're selling like the greatest thing ever
Like you're you have like you're selling like the top tier Mercedes-Benz, right in reality
What you have is equivalent to like a 1996 Civic
It's kind of old. It's rusted. You know, it barely moves. It barely turns on and you know
Your goal is not to pretend like you sell a Mercedes
It's to find the people that are down to rock the 96 Civic that you have
That's actually what you're trying to do right now
And a lot of you it's actually exhausting to pretend like you're selling a Mercedes
You're selling something that's hyper legitimate when in reality you have like this rusty old car
And I also think this again based on my I reflected on this this morning
100% of you are very good at selling.
Like every single one of you here
is actually pretty good at selling.
Let me tell you why.
One, you were able to talk about what you're working on.
One of the first actually good things about selling
is knowing what you are selling, right?
So you're able to talk about what you are doing.
You're able to show a demo actually.
All of you have like a visual that you can like,
that you have that like corresponds
to what you're working on, right?
So it's not just like voices.
And then three, I think all of you are able
to have a conversation and learn from others.
Like you all feel like kind of normal people
that can have normal conversations
and not be weird about it, right?
You can learn from other people
and have these conversations.
So if someone does feel like they hate your thing
or they do have feedback,
I think all of you are actually pretty good at like taking it
like and not taking it too personally, hopefully.
These are all important things
and this is actually everything you need to sell.
And today I just wanna cover three strategies
to help you all improve your selling game
even for like these next four days until Friday
and hopefully for the next, you know,
and number of weeks we have left here.
So the first thing is,
and this is maybe the most important one
where if you take away anything
from what I'm saying here today, it is this.
It is stop marketing, start selling.
What is marketing?
This is what marketing is.
This is like my definition of marketing.
Marketing and also Chachipiti's definition of marketing
based on what I asked it.
It's building an audience for your work.
That's marketing.
It's creating a mass of people who you encourage
to buy or support or be a part of what you are doing.
That's marketing, right?
I think we all kind of know what marketing is
and I think when we think of marketing,
we often think of things like Apple or Nike, right?
They make these great campaigns,
they make us feel like we want their products.
That's marketing.
Selling is this.
Selling is getting them to actually take the action
that you want them to take at the end of the funnel, right?
At the end of the day.
Maybe it's a follow, maybe it's a listen,
maybe it's a purchase,
Maybe it's for them to use your product and be inactive.
Whatever it is, that's the end action, right?
So that's the difference.
So whenever I say the word selling, by the way,
I know that usually means a good in exchange for money,
but please just kind of think about selling
as really the ability to get someone else
to take an action that you want them to take.
That's what selling is.
And that's a very big difference
between marketing and selling.
I think most of you all today, many of you,
not all of you, are actually marketing most of the days.
And I wanna kinda prove,
I'm not saying it's a bad thing actually.
I'm not saying you should stop either.
But I kinda wanna put some data
around what you are doing for a second.
A lot of you are doing this.
You are, you start with something like an email,
or a Reddit post, or a TikTok,
or a Reel, or a Twitter post, right?
That's like one of your starting actions.
From there, you expect people to then go
to your landing page or your link tree.
From there, you expect them to then go
and then take their first step to do something, right?
So maybe it's like listening to your song,
maybe it's buying something or subscribing, right?
So you're expecting them to take one, two,
three, four actions, right?
It's actually four actions, sorry.
So from the landing page, you know,
they see your landing page, they see your link tree.
You now expect them to click something
on your link tree or your landing page, you know?
It's one thing to look at your landing page, right?
But you expect them to actually click something,
like go to something.
And then you expect them to do the most important thing,
which is now, they follow you on Spotify.
They made an account on your website, blah, blah, blah.
Do you see how crazy this is?
It's actually pretty hard to do, right?
Let's put some industry average numbers on this, right?
Industry average, I would say, is this,
at least for BuildSpace, this is like,
my experience are numbers for this sort of flow.
100% of people will come and see your Instagram Reel, right?
So they can't not watch your Reel,
it's just gonna pop up, right?
So they watched it.
10% of them go to your profile, right?
Or sorry, 10% of them go to your profile
and click your link tree or your landing page, right?
Or maybe they click the link if you posted a link, right?
1% of them will literally go to your landing page
and maybe click create account,
or maybe click pre-order your song,
or maybe click something else, right?
And of those, 0.5%, or of the whole 100%,
0.5% at the end will actually take that action.
And if the percent still makes sense to you,
let's add real people.
That means if 100 people see your tweet,
10 people will click the link,
one people will click the actual CTA,
and then you have 0.5 people at the end
who actually take an action,
which rounds out to zero people,
because there's no such thing as half a person.
So this is reality.
A lot of you send 100 people to your stuff
and then nothing happens and you're like,
wow, nothing happened.
Why?
Well, it's because the math is against you.
You simply are losing to this, right?
You thought you were selling, but in reality you're not.
You're just, you're getting destroyed by this right now.
And then, what do you have to do then, right?
In reality, you have to send that,
if you do this strategy,
you have to send a lot more people in the door.
Let's just say it's 1,000.
You just put 1,000 people in the door, right?
100 people click a link.
10 people click create account,
five people actually then go and literally
finish making the account, buy your shirt,
listen to your song, blah blah blah, right?
It's fucking, it's actually crazy, it's actually insane.
But this is reality, right?
This is actually how reality works.
Not everyone you show your stuff to will magically be
like this user of the thing that you want to do
and it's the depressing reality that only 99
or some small percent of people will stick around
by the end, right?
And that's okay though, because the world moves fast
and the best you can do is get them through this, right?
So this is a game I think a lot of you guys here
are playing right now, you're playing this game.
You're trying to play the game of getting people
through all these steps.
And then, can anyone tell me what maybe
is a different game we can play?
Yes.
So we haven't been doing this,
we haven't played Post-Up Reddit or anything,
so we've been doing some basic things,
just door knocking, and then being really nice to people
and having real conversation with them.
And then if they have a problem,
they're gonna solve it and say,
hey, we can solve your problem.
Okay, great.
So I think Kieran's onto something here,
which is that what if you just went straight
to the five people?
Like if your goal is to get these five people,
why don't you just go straight to the five people?
It's gonna be hard to find those five people,
like in the real world, in real life,
but what if you actually just somehow went straight there?
I wanna give a small example here.
At BuildSpace, when we were starting off,
I wasn't marketing at all.
We were selling.
What does that mean?
Selling meant you came to Buildspace,
made an account, and you did a tutorial with us.
That's what I was optimizing for, right?
So then, yeah, I'm not gonna sit there
and make TikToks, right?
What am I gonna do?
Oh, let's make landing pages for every college,
and then go to every college's CS Discord,
and then essentially onboard people
from individual colleges into Buildspace,
by essentially creating a college themed page
for every college, right?
Now this ended up working for us, why?
Because very early on, our first users
came from college CS discord groups.
We just learned that, right?
It's like, oh cool, they're just coming
from these groups anyways, what if we did more of that?
And then we, that was a very direct way to the audience.
And of course, these types of students,
they loved this sort of thing because I can do a thing,
I built space, put on my resume.
So yeah, of course I'm gonna do that.
But this is an example of just going straight
to the five people, right?
I didn't, but even here, like some people
are gonna see my Discord post,
and then they're gonna turn, right?
But for the most part, this is a lot more targeted.
Like 90% more targeted than making like a YouTube video,
or making like an ad per se, or like a reel.
Because I'm going straight to my people.
And where are my people?
My people being college students, CS college students.
Oh, they're in Discord groups.
Okay, so then all I have to do
is get in every single Discord group,
and make a relationship with every single moderator,
and then that's it.
So we had like 100 relationships with,
over 100 moderators that we had relationships with
at that point, within the course of a month.
And we had a very clear funnel, right?
Every CS Discord group gave us on average 35 users.
So if we had 100 Discord groups, we have 3,500 users, right?
Still a hard game to play actually,
but that's how we got 3,500 people to first sign up
for what we were doing.
It's actually really, really difficult.
But again, this was a lot more targeted.
And it was kind of us going straight to the people.
And I wanna cover a couple of examples here with you all.
I remember Daniel was there for office hours last week.
Where's Daniel?
Daniel, yeah.
He was there for office hours last week.
And he was like, all right, Farza,
I'm gonna start making content.
What type of content should I make?
I'm like, well, Daniel, why are you making content?
And he's like, oh, well, I need to sell more of the blocks.
Well, it's like, is content the most efficient way
to sell more blocks?
Like is that, is you making funny videos
or you making these videos?
It's certainly one way, but is it the most efficient way
to sell more of these devices?
And then immediately I think people in the group
started having some more ideas, which is like,
what if you sold blocks to coworking spaces?
Can you call up 10 coworking spaces
and then have them all buy five blocks for their offices?
What if you sold the block to schools, teachers,
who want their students to be more focused
when they get into class.
So teachers spend $10 of their own money
to buy the block, right?
And I think it was these sorts of ideas
that got us thinking, like, oh wow,
like I don't have to sit here
and just expect people to go through this flow.
Like, again, even with Daniel's case,
it was how do I go straight to the five people, right?
And then who are your five people?
Oh, maybe it's teachers who want
to make their kids more focused,
co-working spaces who want to do X,
you know, even, I was saying even go to companies,
like small companies that want their workers
to be more focused, who knows, right?
I don't know what's actually gonna work.
Anybody else have different ideas?
That's not just, you know, make videos about the block.
What other, any other ideas?
I don't know how I can sell this, yeah?
Go to the store.
And then do what?
And then,
conference is about selling to the store.
Sure, great, we can try it.
Yeah, let's go to a store where people buy stuff like this
and say, can you stock this?
Why not?
Yeah, sounds like an okay use of time.
Maybe it takes an hour or two, who knows?
Yes?
Hacker houses?
Hacker houses, sure.
Let's hit up every hacker house and say,
do you want your people to be hacking
in a more focused way?
Why not?
Again, these things, I don't know if it's gonna work,
but worth a shot,
because we're going straight to the person.
Anybody else?
Maybe one more?
Yeah, Roweth.
Schools?
Yeah, exactly, yeah, I think I mentioned schools.
Like, your average teacher, I think,
would, I don't know, a middle school teacher
might love this, you know?
I'm not sure how annoying it is for kids
to use their devices in class nowadays.
I don't know, but I'm guessing
it's pretty annoying for teachers.
But I don't know.
So again, that's another, that's an example, right?
Of, hey Daniel, you don't actually have to make
a bunch of videos that get,
where you talk about your thing
and then get a bunch of followers and blah, blah, blah, blah.
You can actually just make a call
and just sell like 10 tomorrow.
Like how can we do that?
Another example, Chesky, right?
Brayden here somewhere?
Yes, so Brayden,
again, Brayden can do the same thing again,
which is post on Reddit,
post on a bunch of places
and then expect people to come in.
But again, he's playing this game, right?
So Brandon, if you push 100 people from like a subreddit,
or 100 people from maybe say Product Hunt,
you end with not that many people, right?
What's like another idea that we can have for Braden
where you can just get potential people playing chess
to use this thing?
Yeah, Kieran.
Finally, chess clubs, go to chess clubs,
and you guys wanna do it.
Yeah, exactly, that's my answer.
Like literally go to a local chess club
if they still exist, and then literally show up
and like yo, you guys wanna use this?
Anybody else?
How can we get, yes?
Go to a chess tournament.
Go to a chess tournament, yeah.
Is there one happening this weekend?
I don't know, I'm not, let's see.
Anything else?
Yes?
Start a chess tournament.
Start a chess tournament, yeah.
And then maybe get beginner, novice chess players
to come in, use the space and play chess,
and then if they want to get better,
$10 a month for chess-ski, you know?
Like, I don't know, why not?
You know, one person gave me a really cool idea
on Instagram, because we posted Brayden's thing,
and they said you should pay chess streamers,
because chess is a huge thing on social media.
Every big streamer plays chess.
It's like, oh, I know you're not made of money, Brayden,
but huh, $100 for a chess streamer
that gets 1,000 euros on average,
and then they use Chesskey for 20 minutes?
Doesn't sound that crazy.
Worth a shot.
Worth to see how much they cost.
Why not, right?
But again, these are all great ideas,
all ideas that are much better than just marketing Chesskey,
which I don't think is going to work.
Yeah?
What are your thoughts on this whole influencer model?
For example, like in our case,
like we're thinking of the relationships with DevOps blocks
or platform engineering blocks.
Yeah, so essentially influencer marketing?
Yeah, in a way, yeah.
Yeah, no, I think that's good and it's worth a shot.
It still feels like what is an even more direct way,
but influencer stuff is cool, yeah, right?
Yeah.
But I love the ideas like the one Karen mentioned
or even the one Kelly mentioned, which is just,
Can you just go to where people play chess and then just show them and then see what they say? Yeah
So I was the question
I think in the early days, the more FaceTime you can get, the better.
And I'll talk some more about this as well, about how you can optimize FaceTime.
But yeah, I think in the early days for where you guys are at, yeah, what's the best way
to sell?
Often it's like someone showing up in front of your face and then having a conversation
with you or being shown the thing.
Again, go to where your people are.
That's kind of like my best I can say.
Yeah.
So then would you say that it might be worthwhile on the front end to compromise
cash flow for utility just to familiarize those five people with what a taste of what it is you
might have to offer yeah i mean i think most of you are kind of strapped for cash so i think you
should get these people to pay money um if you're if you're selling something like honestly um yeah
unless you have some money to kind of spare then sure but yeah you should probably make a find a
way to get to just give you some dollars um maybe really interesting i think that the most classic
way for an artist to kind of grow is kind of like making content right and I would almost challenge
that a little bit which is like damn can we just throw a concert here or can we throw a concert
somewhere for like 100 people 50 people like what does that kind of look like what does that sound
like is that a more efficient way at the end of the day I don't know is that a more efficient way
to get to the get to those five people at the end who really love your stuff right at the end of the
day that's what we're trying to do we're trying to find the people who love your stuff and I think
I don't know if that's one way to do it.
Any other ideas here on this sort of thing?
Yes?
Get the song to play at a club movie.
Sometimes people can go up and request songs.
One more time, what is it?
If you go to a club, sometimes you can ask them to play a song.
So you can get your songs.
Sure, sure.
I think that's an idea where it's like, can I have a themed night
one night where I'm part of the listing even, right?
I think there's a lot of what generally we should do with these ideas
is like, my recommendation is you'll likely come up
with a lot of these ideas, like even for Braden,
like is it worth it for Braden to literally go
to a chess tournament and spend all this Friday,
Saturday there?
We don't know actually, but what I recommend doing
for all these things that we're talking about
is pick activities that are like really, really high value
for you and not that much effort.
So again, going to a chess tournament
is actually the highest value thing,
effort thing you can do.
You're spending two days now, or a day at a chess tournament
versus like, damn, could we have just gotten
into like five chess club discords?
Would that have been faster?
Could that have been done in an hour?
And then again, it's your responsibility as the builder
to not get sucked into stuff that's gonna like,
the sound's really cool and could work,
but then like, doesn't.
So again, the club thing.
That could be the best idea ever, I don't know,
or it could be like a massive time sink.
It's just like how do you optimize that task
and just test it really fast.
Yeah, and I think this is my kind of take on growth, right?
like eventually these strategies will stop working, right?
Eventually it won't working.
I remember for BuildSpace,
going to colleges just stopped working.
Like we just, one, ran out of interesting colleges,
and two, ran out of discords we could bug.
We just ran out, right?
So it breaks.
But until it breaks, keep doing it.
And then, yeah, you gotta discover other stuff, you know?
Second thing, have a one-on-one conversation.
Yeah, this one's actually kinda hard to understand.
Because you all don't understand that you're kind of superpower or you're kind of like
You have the superpower, which is that you're an individual and you're not that big and you can actually give people like
You're like one-on-one time
Which is actually kind of interesting. Let me see what and I think what that mean what I mean by that is
Right now at this stage like I said earlier you all of you have like this 1996 Honda Civic, right?
It's like why are people gonna like
like check out your Honda Civic.
It's not because it's a good car.
You know, that's like maybe,
maybe they get in because of that,
but no, it's because they enjoy the conversation with you.
They think that you're interesting.
They think that what you're working on
and how you're talking about it is interesting.
Because you're telling them this Honda Civic
is gonna be sick in like two months.
And they're like, oh shit, cool.
Like, can I check it out right now?
Like, give it a shot.
Does that kind of make sense?
It's like your actual power is that you're an individual
and you're someone who cares about what you're working on.
You're not just like another like NPC
that's trying to sell something on the TikTok shop,
which is, I don't know, it's not as interesting.
And never underestimate this, ever.
I'll give you an example here just for myself.
My first customer ever for this company,
for Zip Homeschool, was this woman named Lucy Moore.
She had a young daughter.
She was from, I believe, Texas or Georgia.
And every single week, I'd have a conversation
with Lucy one-on-one.
Just to give you guys context, at this point,
I was offering my customers a curriculum.
So it's like most, it's almost like most homeschooling
companies offer their customers curriculum,
like math exercises, reading exercises, blah, blah, blah.
Now, of course, I didn't have any curriculum.
That takes years to build up.
It takes expertise to build up.
But what I did have was myself.
And this fake person named Griffin,
who I mentioned at the top here.
But you know, me and Griffin were like,
we're a dream team.
And essentially every week on every,
like I think Monday or something,
I talked to Lucy one-on-one, 30 minutes.
She'd tell me what her daughter was struggling with.
I would literally then go learn about
how to make good exercises for her daughter.
And I would at the end of every week, Friday,
give her a Google doc with all the exercises
that she could do with her daughter and reading and math.
Now again, this is stuff that a big company can't do.
But also like understanding that I'm at a fault, right?
Like I don't have a giant library of content
for my people to enjoy.
How the fuck am I gonna compete with anyone else, right?
Well, here's how I can compete.
A mother looking for very, you know,
targeted kind of exercises for her daughter,
reading and math exercises.
I can do that.
And of course, maybe the first time I sucked at it,
but then by week eight, we were on a float, you know?
I got really good at it.
And over time, I eventually hired someone
to then do this for me, right?
But again, that's the concept of having
like a one-on-one conversation,
like putting your personality and everything
into what you got.
Because again, at this point I had nothing.
It was literally nothing.
It was just a promise.
But then yeah, had a chat with her, she trusted me,
it worked out, right?
So I think this is kind of worth internalizing
that yeah, there's a lot of noise guys
and you're special in the sense that
you will actually take a moment
and give people some attention that will support you.
All right?
At the end of the day, like,
I'm opening up all sorts of social media,
all sorts of places where there's millions of people,
thousands of comments, blah, blah, blah.
It can actually get kind of exhausting
even as the viewer, right?
So then if you think about that,
as a compassion for the viewer even,
how can you potentially make the viewer's day?
Or make the day of somebody that could potentially find
what you're working on interesting, all right?
You know, if it's chess key, for example,
I'm sure someone who's up and coming in chess
or just like is interested in the game on Reddit,
or interested in the game in like Braden's DMs,
and Braden gives them 25 minutes of his time
for an intro lesson, free lesson, that'd be sick.
I'm sure they'll remember that for a long time.
And then of course it's up to them
if they didn't want to subscribe to Chesky, right?
That's kind of how I see it.
And I think as a creator, this is kind of hard.
Your goal is not to sell them anything.
It's the hard part.
And your goal also isn't to like become their best friend.
It's somewhere in the middle.
And it's like a really hard line to kind of tread
because if I'm great and I'm selling chess key
and I get in the call, then all they're thinking about is
fuck, this guy's just trying to upsell me
for a $10 monthly package to his chess software.
This is, this is, damn it.
But then also, you know, not trying to become your friend
because you can't become everyone's friend, very hard.
Somewhere in the middle.
So you have to tread that line as a creator.
And again, so what do you do on these calls,
on these emails, on these whatever,
on these in real life conversations that you have
with the people that are interested in what you're working on.
It's just to learn.
You just wanna learn about their life,
you wanna learn about their existence,
and then at the end, you wanna present a solution
if you've got one.
Again, kinda like my dad selling a car.
You just learn a lot about their life,
about their family, about their existence,
and at the end, hey, if they want to like,
if they seem really protective of their teenager
and selling the blind spot detector thing makes sense,
then he'll do it, you know what I mean?
That's kinda like the difference
Versus just being like, hey man,
buy these blind spot detectors for $2,000.
It's like, no man, I just wanna get in my car and leave.
So it's like, you gotta kinda think about that.
Kind of like one mental model or one mental picture
I would like to paint for you is,
imagine going to a party and then having you
at the front waving, like you see someone,
you're like, hey!
You're just waving at them, you're like,
you're clapping when they come,
you give them a high five when they walk in the door.
You know, like you know that feeling?
Where like, where a person would do that for you?
Versus you show up at the door of your party, right?
And you look at the door,
and it says scan the QR code first of all, okay?
You scan the QR code, and then it's like,
okay, now go to the back, okay, now go to the back.
Okay, now pay me, now authenticate with Google.
Okay, cool, I'm gonna authenticate with Google,
and then I get into the party, right?
Like that's, instead of doing all that,
why not just greet them at the door?
Like why are you making your life so hard?
just let them into the party and they'd be a lot more fun
if you greet them like that too.
And again, use this mental picture to kind of like,
to kind of like help you understand how to use a strategy
based on what you're working on, right?
I think that's super important.
And by the way, I wanna distinguish this from networking
because this can easily start sounding like networking.
Let me tell you what networking is for a moment.
This is what networking is.
You are making fake friends and connections
to move yourself forward for your own purely selfish reasons.
Like that's kind of what networking is to me.
And conversation just means getting to know each other.
There's actually a difference.
And I kind of want to go through
just a couple of examples here.
And feel free to chime in if you have any other thoughts
on each example.
But this is what Anish and Amara are working on, right?
They're making a product that helps you buy things
as an AI shopping assistant.
Are they here right now?
Yes, so I think last week they told me that, you know,
it's kinda hard to get people to kinda show up
and buy something and do the whole flow, right?
Like that's kinda like one of the problems,
like buying something's kinda like a longer term
ordeal technically, right?
And I remember last week Rana bought a camera
and I think my thought today while making this presentation
was, Dan, what if they made like a Calendly link
which essentially said, hey, book a time with us
and we will help you buy your camera,
like right on the call.
Like we are your shopping assistant.
And in the background, you're using your tool, right?
Sounds kind of weird, right?
Sounds kind of like twisted, but at the end of the day,
what does the person want?
They want to buy a camera, they want to buy the book, right?
Damn, okay, can I just hop in a 20 minute call with you,
literally figure it out right there with you,
like with a human assistant that's actually using your tool
in the background, and then they buy it right there
from your website, boom, done.
Again, I don't know if that'll work,
but I think there's a much higher chance
that it can work, you know?
So like you are, you're playing a different game.
You're playing the one-on-one conversation game,
which I think could possibly work, right?
So again, that's just kind of one idea for like,
because I think one-on-one kind of like,
the one-on-one interactions can actually be built
into anything you all do.
And this is just one example for them.
This is really interesting, right?
So in this case, they're working on a diabetes kind of
a tracker, right?
A diabetes assistant, so we'll call it a personal,
how do you guys describe it today?
Like a personal diabetes assistant?
Cool, so essentially like,
the best way to describe it today is just that they,
like what do you think is the number one reason
someone uses this today?
Yeah, essentially, and then there's like
an AI bot built into it, right?
Sorry, I never tried it.
I still have not connected my Dexcom.
But I think on this one in particular,
my first thought every time I see this tool
is that damn, they should just book one-on-one calls
with people with diabetes and then show them this.
And then if they just do 30 of those in a day,
how many of those at the end will want to buy this?
It's really up to them, right?
But again, imagine you show up to a website
and it says, hey, like $20 a month,
personal diabetes assistant, versus $20 a month,
or versus like book a call with us
and let us show it to you, right?
Now so if someone with diabetes,
which seems like a painful disease,
that seems kind of better, right?
versus another robotic flow that I go through.
I don't know if it's real.
I get scammed all the time in the medical industry.
I'm going back to Facebook.
Versus, oh, I just book a call with them,
and I'm gonna get a person?
Okay, cool, let's check that out.
One other example, for Nyati,
this is the hardest even one to understand,
but damn, I'm sure some of your viewers
kind of feel what you are saying, right?
Damn, what would it take to have 20 minutes with one of them?
to at least learn from them, to at least,
for them to get a sense of what you're working on,
for them to get a better understanding of you, right?
There's nothing wrong with that.
In fact, that's like a superpower.
I wish I could still have one-on-one conversations
with everyone who comes through Bill's face.
Like, that'd be amazing.
But I can't, it's hard.
So you should do this while you can't,
because it's really fun.
I wanna give you one small example
from just my own, my own past.
This is Convoke.
He's like my third favorite artist of all time.
He's a rapper.
And at one time I met Convoke randomly
at a video game tournament.
And this guy was just, first of all,
he's just the nicest guy ever.
He saw me, I'm like, are you Convoke?
He's like, yeah, man.
He just hugged me and he just said,
what's going on, dude?
What's your favorite song?
And I said, I fucked up with my favorite song.
He's like, yeah, yeah, nice, dude.
And he spent an hour with me.
He spent an hour with me just hanging out with me,
just talking to me.
It was one of the coolest things that's ever happened
to me because I loved the guy.
He was like one of my favorites.
So seeing him was like mind blowing.
And then to this day, that was like four or five years ago.
To this day, every time he drops a video,
a tweet, an Instagram story,
I don't care what he drops, I'm like on it.
I'm like, what is Convoke saying?
Because it almost feels like,
I'm definitely not friends with Convoke,
but I really enjoy what he's putting out,
I enjoy who he, I thought he was a good person,
and I wanna keep supporting him.
That's it.
And you know, I don't think convok when he talked to me was trying to make me a fan
I think he was just being himself. So that's another way another kind of thing to think about
But yeah, it's crazy. He every time he drops anything. I'm there in a moment's notice me and Alec both actually
And my last and third final thing I want to talk about is on how to like up your selling game
No matter what you're working on is please pick the easiest person to sell to
I want to give you an example again
In 2018 we were working on build space at the time build space. We called it build space
We actually reused the name but at the time we were working on a cloud IDE for college students
So basically if you join a computer science
Major you have to like set up do a bunch of setup right around your terminal around your coding environment, etc
Essentially they will spend the first week on just helping you set up your coding environment
So you could code on your laptop. It was kind of ridiculous
So you know after college me and Alec were like we should make something that
Makes it such that you don't have to fucking do that right and then so we were off right?
We literally built the product and like it took us like two weeks to build it. We built it and
We tried to sell it to schools and if you know schools
Universities take six to twelve months to sign a contract
Yeah
So, it's the same thing and then we talk to a professor.
It's like, don't do this.
It's actually a good idea.
That's so funny.
Yeah, this is like one of those ideas that a lot of people do.
Kind of like the other idea people do a lot is like an app that
helps you split your bill.
That's the other really popular app people make.
Again, this is one of those popular apps we had no idea.
And again, yeah, it takes us 12 months to lock down a contract.
We didn't know that.
So we spent three months on just that.
And then we gave up on that.
But then we were like, OK, OK, maybe schools aren't it.
Let's sell it to students, you know?
And that was our great idea.
Can anybody tell me what happened?
If you tried, yes.
Students have no money.
That is the learning.
We failed, horrendously.
Why?
We picked the hardest people in the world to sell to.
Schools and students.
Now, in retrospect, it makes perfect sense,
but in the moment, we didn't think about that.
We didn't think, we were so deep in it
that we didn't even think that these people
are difficult to sell to.
In retrospect, I wish we sold to people
that were easier to sell to.
For example, the tool was actually really good.
Could this have been sold to, I don't know,
people tutoring 12 year olds in programming?
Sounds a lot faster,
sounds like I just have to go to the parent.
Yeah?
I'm here to build my own when I distribute.
Yeah?
I feel the exact same thing.
Shit dude, you see what I mean?
Dude, we should start a company together.
Yeah, so sounds like a lot of people
have the same thoughts.
And again, it's cool in retrospect,
You can look back, right, and think about these things.
I mean, in the moment it was so hard.
We were just so locked in, like,
student, student, student, student, school, school, school.
You know, so it was like,
and you know, we had so many people tell us
that it was gonna be hard, and we were like, ah, you know.
Nah, you know.
Like many of you, we also learned the hard way
over many years.
At the end of the day, no one can tell us enough
that it's not gonna work.
Give us, all the advice in the world
isn't gonna shift our minds.
You know, we were kind of just stubborn.
But yeah, we'd be the hardest people in the world to sell to.
And I think a lot of people, a lot of you,
will end up picking really difficult people to sell to.
Not saying you're doing that right now.
Actually, I think most of you are kinda okay.
But you can always make it easier for yourself.
You know what I mean?
Like, you can always change who your target is
to make it easier.
Because you choose, right?
So, I think, you know, Ryan, you're selling clothing, right?
So clothing's actually pretty hard to sell,
like to just your average person on the street, right?
Like, it's kinda hard for them to then first learn about it,
and like it, and it has to fit them properly,
blah, blah, blah, right?
So in my first thought with clothing is that
who can buy clothing in a way that's maybe faster
and lower, what do you call it?
So there's not as much push you have to do, right?
So again, we can go through options all day,
but again, I've had a clothing company before,
I sold to companies, right?
I would sell like 50 of the same hat to companies,
50 of the same shirt to companies, right?
But again, at the end of the day,
who knows if that'll be better.
It's just worth a shot.
But you can just know, you can kind of adjust
who you sell to at the end of the funnel
in little small ways.
Don't do massive shifts.
Like one week you're selling to developers,
the next week you're selling to basketball players.
You know what I mean?
These are big shifts.
Just experiment around with who you actually
are trying to get it to.
I think that's okay.
But if you have questions there and you're not sure,
you can always ask us.
I think Bonnie, yours is really interesting.
Where Bonnie could really complicate this actually,
in the sense of, who's your customer today,
as of today, for this thing?
Well, my plan was to go to gift shops this weekend
and ask them if I could maybe just
be there for the weekend and grab people's gifts at cost.
Great.
Cool.
No, yeah, makes sense.
I think on that, even just hearing that,
always kind of stay flexible, right?
Because for all you know, no gift shop replies to you.
And that's okay, right?
But then it's like, okay, who's someone else
that's maybe like less push is required
for me to get through the door?
So even for you, there's so many places
for like this to like be sold and like become a thing.
Just no need to get married to a specific like segment,
you know, or a specific type of like strategy.
Again, I've done it so many times, so yeah,
if that happens to me, it can definitely happen to you.
Yeah, Abel, you know, selling to, where's Abel,
are you here somewhere?
Oh yes.
You're selling to medical students.
Sounds hard, you know?
Doesn't sound impossible, but sounds hard, right?
Is it hard?
Yeah, yeah.
It's, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, it's hard.
So I think, even when I see something like this,
my kind of thing is like, hey, like,
don't kind of like get caught up in the rut
of selling to medical students.
Like, who's somebody else that's maybe slightly adjacent
that we can try out this week, you know?
You can argue that this is like losing focus,
but honestly, I don't know,
it sounds like you spent a lot of weeks on medical students.
Like maybe let's try something else.
You know, maybe let's adjust a little bit.
Maybe you can change who you sell to,
and maybe it'll be, you have to like do,
you have to force your way into the door a little bit less.
Right?
Cool, so those are my kind of three,
my three, my three I guess tips,
or my three learnings from what I've kind of like,
just things that work for me basically.
At the end of the day, I don't like to call this advice.
This is just what works for me,
and I think you guys can take away from this what you please.
But my main thing is don't be this guy, you know?
I know you don't think you're being this guy,
but when I see some of you making reels,
and at the end you're like, go to my link,
I'm like, ah.
You just look like this guy, you know?
Like nobody wants to interact with this guy.
Or I see your tweet, it's like a beautiful tweet,
And at the end you're like, check out my thing.
And I'm like, well, again,
I don't think that's gonna happen.
You can try all day.
Keep trying, of course, you know.
My biggest thing I want you to take away from this
is to not stop all those shenanigans.
Like, that's like playing the lottery.
You should play the lottery like every day.
That sounds dope.
Especially because it's a free lottery.
That's even more dope.
But that's what socials are.
That's what posting on these large platforms are.
But don't let that be your strategy.
You know, like that's not a strategy.
That's not a strategy to sell.
Strategies to sell at this stage should be more like one-one.
They should be a lot more kind of like direct, right?
And yeah, just be a little more like this guy, you know?
Look at him.
And yeah, I think if that happens,
I think the group will end up looking
a little bit less like this,
and maybe a little bit more like this, actually.
You'll still have people in all sorts of stages, right?
But I don't think it's that crazy for you all
to have a big push by the end of this week,
like every single one of you.
And I know I have a very good idea of the states
of every single one of your projects.
I see what you're doing, I watch your exam days,
I see your updates in the chats.
I have a pretty solid sense of where most of you are at.
Well, 95% of you.
And yeah, I feel like you got something,
you just gotta really start selling it.
And I think that's what it's gonna take.
At the end of the day, remember,
I can sit here all day and say these things to you,
and I think for some of you it'll hit,
for some of you it won't.
But we're here for you.
Email me if you need me.
I think a lot of people are kind of
don't know how to get in touch with me.
Yeah, just email me.
I don't check my phone much, but email me.
I'm always around, far as I build space.
And I actually look at that often.
One on one with Ameth, please continue.
Bugging Ameth for one on ones.
Please continue barging into our office.
Who's barging into our office?
I'm curious.
Damn, a lot of you.
Continue barging into our office.
It's totally okay.
If we don't want you there, we will literally say no.
And I've done that many times.
I think it's okay.
Get zombies music to hype you up.
You know?
Do whatever you gotta do by Friday, right?
And again, remember inputs over outputs.
At the end of the day, I don't want you all to be
mentally down if your graph doesn't go up,
because it's one signal, you know?
As long as you're happy every week with your inputs
and what you're actually putting into the game.
Because that's the only thing you control.
I can't stress that enough.
It's very easy to get caught up in the idea that
you're flatline or you're going down or you're flopping.
I don't know.
It's just one graph.
There's many graphs that we could look at.
And that's it, yeah, any questions?
Any questions?
Damn, nice, yes.
