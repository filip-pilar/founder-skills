All right, how's it going everyone?
So today, as always, I woke up in the morning on lecture day and I was like, okay, what should we talk about today?
And I think this is one topic that has actually been kind of coming up a lot in my life.
Because a lot of people have been asking me for help.
Or asking for help from me, which is kind of really interesting because I've always been on the other side.
for so long and I kind of want to just start with as always a quick story to
contextualize things and kind of put it all in perspective for you all on why
this is important and honestly how I am not really even the guy that is the best
in the ward of asking for help which maybe makes me someone that is good at
which maybe makes me kind of equipped to even talk about it a little bit because
I'm still learning on how to ask for help best and I think I just want to
share kind of my journey on how I asked for ALP and how it kind of improved my life. I want to set
a quick scene here. In 2014, I finished high school. I went to my Snapchat memories. I found this.
So there I am. I finished high school and I always wore the same shirts. So here's me on Snapchat
in high school when you think you have a million dollar idea but can't work on it because of chem
homework so if you followed me in the 12th grade you were getting stuff like this right so that's
kind of like the scene um and with all my heart at 18 i just did not want to go to college like
with all my being i didn't want to go because i was already kind of making some good amount of
money selling shirts online so i was happy with that i wanted to keep on working on that um but
hey in 2018 i graduate college and uh i ended up moving out to san francisco this is me my brother
There's my cousin and my dad at my San Francisco apartment.
So again, even though I didn't want to go to college,
I ended up graduating for reasons.
Can anybody guess?
Parents and fathers.
Parents, yes.
Finally, I was free from the clutches
of my Pakistani mother and father,
so I could actually go out into the world.
And finally, I wouldn't dishonor my family
by dropping out, right?
So I kind of felt like, okay, I can finally go out there.
College was pretty useless, definitely, even looking back.
But some cool stuff still happened, right?
For one, I built some products.
This is one product I built,
got about 500k users in that first year.
And I just checked, last year,
it is still getting 234,000 users as of 2023,
which is pretty cool.
And I worked on some AI stuff, this is Deep League.
Again, just random shit I made
that kind of got some people to notice me.
I worked on soft driving cars.
So I still, I still like did stuff in college, right?
Like I still got to do other things, which is great.
But to kind of set the scene,
that's where I was at the end of like college, right?
So that's like 2018.
I had stuff, some stuff was making money,
some stuff was big, some stuff wasn't.
Had some flops, et cetera, right?
But I still really felt very, very stagnated by the end
of when I finished college, which was 2018.
and felt very alone, had very little idea what to do next.
I mean, most people who graduate, who leave college,
generally don't have any idea what to do next.
And I had no idea how to fix the problems that I even had.
Like, I knew my own weaknesses,
and I knew kind of where I kind of wanted to go,
but like very, very, very loosely,
but I still didn't quite know
how to fix the problems that I had.
And yeah, I had no one around me
who I thought I could ask for help
for these problems that I was having.
Everything from like, should I move to a different city?
To how do I, is this next app idea I have any good?
You know, like questions like that.
I'd always been so solo in my whole life,
up until this point, like I'd never asked anybody
for help ever, like completely solo got to where I was.
And again, I got to this point,
which was decently okay point,
but now I felt like damn, like I kinda need,
I have no one around to help me now,
Like this is so sad.
On top of that, yeah, in 2018,
I really did suck at asking for help
because I felt like I had to conquer the world
as a solo player.
I felt like for some reason that was baked into my head.
And so I kind of realized this
and I started to write a newsletter.
I don't know why I started this even looking back,
to be honest with you.
I guess I was just feeling kind of hopeless in it all.
And I was like, okay, at the very least,
I'm doing stuff every week.
Let me just talk about it online,
at the very least, right?
I didn't know what Twitter was, I didn't have Instagram,
I just had a Snapchat, and I was like,
okay, I have a Snapchat and I have this email thing,
so I'll talk about what I'm doing there.
So I start to write the newsletter.
I wrote it every week for nearly four years,
so I was kinda hyper consistent on it.
And have any of you ever read my newsletter?
I'm just curious who here.
Great, yeah, you're not missing out on much, eh, Alec.
But I can talk a little about the contents.
It covered various things, this newsletter.
This was my first newsletter ever, Tuesday, November 13th, 2018.
And I was working on this thing called Buildspace,
which was very different from what it is today.
But this was way back when, like right after college.
And Buildspace is a place where users can learn new things,
mainly programming by combining their interests with something that they enjoy.
So that's what it was way back then.
And you can see how many people are on the email list there, right?
We have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
There's Alec, there's my dad, there's Sharif,
who you see walking around a lot.
So kind of like the characters that you,
the characters in my life that I've just,
these are the only people I felt like would care about
what I was working on.
So I started.
I then kept talking about stuff.
I started talking about the anime I was watching.
So Death Note, how many of you have seen Death Note?
Yeah, so in this email newsletter,
I was talking about like specific fan theories
about Death Note.
Specifically, you know, in Death Note,
you write someone's name and they die?
I was like, oh shit, that's a plot hole.
What if someone doesn't have a name, right?
Do they die?
And so I fucking Googled it,
I went into like the Death Note Stack Exchange,
got my answer.
Like no, actually that person was automatically assigned,
is automatically assigned a name 780 days in
by a Shinigami.
So again, based on everything I'm saying right now,
I was sometimes talking about just straight nonsense.
I talked about my ideas for stuff I had,
stuff I could build in the future.
So again, this is all 2018.
This was an idea that I had.
Create a program that is able to scan programs
for common mistakes using machine learning
and then kind of help the engineer
find their problems faster, right?
I would also just be talking about stuff like
new ideas I had, right?
So this was another idea I had called Kenga 2.
And again, the kind of contents were like really vast,
but it was always like my life and what I was working on.
So just to give you guys context, right?
Initially, no one really gave a fuck, you know?
Like, no one replied.
I had my dad, you know, Bazar Majid,
so he would reply to a lot of them.
So, you know, as long as you are,
Frazan, as long as you're on top of your shit,
you have no regrets about short-term failures.
You will find, you know, my dad being very supportive,
you will find the light at the end.
Your hard work will pay off, trust me on that.
Keep your brain and body,
keep working on your brain and body, blah, blah, blah.
So, my dad supporting me.
So again, this was kind of one of the first kind of replies
I got to these newsletters.
Alec, so 2019, Alec just being supportive.
Beautiful read, hope to get the concurrent user count up.
So he was talking about how many users I had
and the thing I was working on.
So it was cool, you know, like this,
I got one reply maybe on average every two weeks.
Eventually some new people started popping into my life.
This guy hits me up, David Arnetto.
You remember David Arnetto?
David Arnetto was this random guy at Google.
And he was like, I would love to just talk to you
about your ideas.
at this time, I go, shit, like cool, someone I don't know,
sharing curiosity, I must be onto something.
And I end up going to Google, I end up getting lunch with him,
ends up being a great guy in New York,
and it was just kind of an amazing experience.
And to this day, I don't talk to him to this day,
but I remember we talked for a long time,
and I haven't talked to Dave in a while, how about you?
David Arnetto, hope he's okay, David, if you're watching this.
And so after about a year of doing this, actually,
a year of just like grinding this newsletter,
One guy in particular hits me up that I felt like was kind of different and new a new character in my life and his name was Sean Puri and
How many of you know this guy? I'm just curious
Cool, so this guy at this point Sean Puri is kind of like internet celebrity massive podcast probably biggest business podcast there is
And yeah, just like just like a he's not a nobody. That's for sure, right?
And what's funny is he just replies. This is my first ever interaction with Sean
He replies my newsletter and he's only he just says good luck, bro. Let me know if I can help
And this was the very this is real. This was the real one from 20. I think 19
And I'm just mind-blown right because at the time
I'm a nobody like I'm an absolute nobody at best. I have like a couple of
Things that I built on my github. That's about it
And and Sean was also not a nobody for sure him he had just sold his first company right
But he wasn't anywhere near like where he is today even right so at the end of the day
We're kind of both just randoms actually
But Sean really felt like he was very ahead of me
Like I want to start a company and Sean already started a company and sold the company so they go shit
It's pretty cool like and he just replied to me so all of a sudden it's kind of interesting right
And so the kind of keeps going right every one to two weeks Sean replies to my newsletter
Which at this point has maybe a hundred people on it
He would say sometimes, dope post.
That's it.
Sometimes he would literally,
I would talk about a new idea and he would say,
hey dude, it's good to do stuff like this,
clarifies your thinking, keeps you honest.
I wanna be like, yeah, this is a dope idea, do it.
But in reality, I think this is a fuck.
He's gonna waste six to 12 months of his life on this.
Sometimes replies like that,
just him being honest about what I'm working on.
Sometimes it's just him roasting me.
He's like, this newsletter sucks now.
I miss your newsletter back when it was talking about
you know, what you tried, right?
Now you're just giving unsolicited advice.
They're essentially like stupid medium articles.
Like so sometimes he just roasts me, right?
Sometimes he would just be like, yo, like,
let's talk tomorrow, what's your number?
Like he would just literally be like, yo,
are you available right now, you know?
Sometimes he would help me go through
with some really tough emotional decisions.
I remember one in particular,
I wanted to leave a company that I co-founded.
And I was so had no one to talk to about that talk to Sean. I remember I'd gone the phone with him two hours
We figured it out
It got to the point where we're thinking about starting a company together
We're talking all about our idea
Everything right so it kind of kind of crazy right that it all started from just a guy being like here
Right because I think a lot of you probably have people like this in your life. They're down to help you
but I don't know, I feel like a lot of times
it takes a certain skill to actually get help from them
and to build on top of that relationship.
And I wanna just talk about,
and I think this relationship with Sean that I built up,
it was almost all over email, almost all over email.
And they were almost all like little responses like this.
So it's interesting because,
yeah, I think that like,
I think right after this email in particular,
where this guy literally says,
you know, let me just summarize this, right?
At this point, he's like,
I will fly you out to San Francisco,
I will fund you to work on an idea,
and I will literally work with you every week on the idea.
And he even lays out how much we split ownership,
like everything's kind of laid out.
And I'm like mind blown at this point.
I'm like, holy shit,
Like, this guy is really down to help me.
Like, he's really down to take a chance on me and help me.
And it's at that moment where I was like,
damn, I should navigate the world
with other people alongside me.
I should bring other people along my journey.
I shouldn't have to just play the game solo
in my head all day.
And I think this moment in particular
really kind of made that obvious for me.
And yeah, Sean's replies, man,
they really were a weekly blessing.
Like, I would sometimes write that newsletter
just because Sean would reply sometimes.
Because that's my only motivation.
It's like, okay, at the very worst,
there's a 25% chance that Sean reads something interesting
and tells me something interesting.
Right?
And so that was enough for me.
I would just keep on making that newsletter,
which would take me like four hours a week.
Because I think the main thing is Sean helped me
in ways that I didn't know I even needed.
Like I'm not like asking Sean questions.
Like, hey Sean, how do I do X?
It's more like I'm telling Sean my story
and then Sean kind of reflects back like,
have you thought about X, Y, Z?
And that to me was a lot more helpful
because I didn't even know the questions that I had.
I was, I never really, I don't come from the world
of starting companies since, or starting a startup, right?
So he did, and I felt like he helped me navigate that world
because I was like, I came into that,
I came into the startup world not knowing anything.
And so yeah, in 30 emails, 10 to 20 phone calls,
this man changes my trajectory, right?
And I think that is mind blowing,
that in 30 emails and 10 phone calls,
that someone can do that.
Someone that I never met, someone that,
I never met him physically by the way,
until like years later, and it's just mind blowing to me
how that can happen, with very few touch points, right?
So, why am I telling you all this?
Why am I giving you my whole ass story on me and this guy?
Because I actually think that most people,
not just you all, but just most people,
actually really suck at asking for help.
And I thought about this a lot.
I thought about like why, and we'll get more into that,
and like why I think that's the case.
But I think most importantly about why I'm telling you
all this is because I think you all need help.
Not because you're struggling right now.
Some of you could be doing amazing right now.
It's really because you kind of always need help,
even if you don't know it yet.
Why?
That's another question, right?
Like why then do I think that many of you need help?
Because as you work on stuff, you will almost always stagnate.
Like almost always.
Very few cases in life or history where you see people
that just went like forever, you know?
At one point, you won't actually stagnate.
I'm sure you've all seen this kind of comparison many times
where this is what you think it's gonna be like,
you know, you're straight up all the time
for the rest of your life.
But in reality, it looks a lot more like this, right?
Where you kind of get like a big spike
and then you like that.
And you have another big spike and then you're just like that.
And you have another big spike and then you're just flat again.
This to me is like more realistic
because this to me is like shows that you are stagnating, right?
So even if we look at this, right here, right?
You were flat for maybe like three months.
You were like in the sunken place for three months.
But then you figure something out for three months.
And then you were flat for three months.
Then you figure something out in another three months.
And again, then you just went down.
You literally lost.
You were back to where you were like maybe six months ago.
But then, bada bing, you figure something else out.
So these moments, like these moments
where you are like going from like flat to kind of up,
those are moments that are very hard
to figure out by yourself, very hard.
And you actually need to do something
to really force yourself past stagnation.
Otherwise you'll stay,
like you'll stay in this zone for months
if you are just left to yourself actually.
Very few times will you be able to figure out by yourself.
You can, but it's very hard.
So for example, some of you may feel like
you are stuck here right now, right?
And you kind of want to get to this little inflection point,
but it's tough, like you don't really know,
you're putting in the work, what are you missing?
You know, like these types,
don't even know the right questions anymore, right? Some of you may feel like you're here. Like you
feel like you got through the initial thing. You had some magic, but now you're stuck again, you
know? It's tough. And you want to get here. You want to get to like that next inflection point,
but you don't know how. And again, some of you may be like, yo, I'm going backwards. Like things are
going downhill for me. What the fuck am I doing? Am I just like, you know, why am I going backwards?
Why am I going down again?
Like, I want to be going here.
So again, these are things,
these little moments here are like moments of,
or periods of stagnation.
And I think I just want you all to know
that it's very normal
and very difficult to deal with emotionally.
But overall, I just want to let you know
that this is normal.
And again, like I said,
you can break out of this by yourself, I think.
It's just really hard.
It's very hard.
And I think you can only go so far alone.
So what do you need?
you need those people in your life that are ahead of you,
that are willing to help you.
Not just the people that are around you down to support you.
Those are great people to have no matter what.
Like, for example, this group, right?
Your friends you've made here at Build Space.
Those are great people to just have around you forever,
really, they will support you always.
But generally, it's good to have people in your life
that are ahead of you, in your specific domain,
in your specific craft,
in whatever you're trying to get good at, right?
There's always gonna be that person,
at least in my life, you know?
Sean is one example of a person in my life
that helped me break through a major period of stagnation
and helped me figure out my next step, right?
So you'll always have that person,
and I'm sure even today in your lives,
you could probably, you may feel like
there's a person in your life that helped take you
to that next step.
Maybe it's a parent, maybe it's a friend,
maybe it's like a mentor, all right?
So what can this look like?
What can it look like when you're kind of asking for help or looking for help?
There's a few things.
It could look like a classic mentor-mentee relationship, right?
So this is Steve Jobs and Mike Marucola, who was originally Steve Jobs' mentor.
Gave him the money, helped him start the company, right?
This is your classic mentor-mentee relationship.
It could be something like Porter Robinson and Skrillex.
Porter Robinson was nobody.
Skrillex finds him and says, hey man, I wanna help you.
Like, you're making, you made,
Port Robinson made this really great EP called Spitfire
and Skrillex sees that and to this day, 10 years later,
they are still like helping each other
and Port Robinson still sees Skrillex as his mentor.
It may look like Dr. Dre and Eminem.
Eminem was nobody, Dr. Dre finds him
and then fucking 20 years later, here they are,
still collabing, still doing things together.
Again, more of a mentor-mentee relationship.
It can look more like a partnership.
Maybe that's what it ends up being.
Key and Peele, they found each other,
they made each other better, right?
And you can argue that they have made some of the best
kind of improv comedy stuff I've ever seen.
A lot of people, anyone know who the guy on the left is?
Walt Disney.
Anyone go on?
Many of you, probably no one knows
who the guy on the right is, I'm guessing, at that point.
But, hmm?
No, not Roy.
This is Ub Iwerks.
He was the kind of more expert animator in the early days.
So when Walt Disney first started,
Walt was pretty good,
but this guy was even better at animation.
Like he was like, you know you have like
the really like great like developer, right?
That just like will come in and like do it better than you.
Yeah, that guy was like that before animation
back in the early, I'm not sure what year this is.
But again, Walt had that partner, right?
Because Walt Disney knew like,
I'm not the best animation.
I need a guy that's gonna help me figure it out.
And found this guy, right?
So that's more of a partnership.
You can keep going, this is Miyazaki.
Miyazaki was great at making movies,
but sucked at marketing them.
So he found this other guy, his name's Suzuki.
Suzuki to this day markets every Ghibli movie.
So again, you need help.
It can come in any format.
It can look like this, or it can look like this.
It really just depends.
Or it can look as simple as this.
I saw this moment today.
I took a picture, Niyati and Ali.
I don't know what was going on, but, Niyati, what was going on?
Were you showing him something funny?
Or?
I was just showing him on Mylene's Instagram.
You were just showing him on Mylene's Instagram.
Great!
Yeah.
Just a moment like this can be like, what do you think?
Again, I'm not sure if you were asking for help in that moment,
but it looked to me like you were asking for help,
or you were just helping each other in a weird way.
I don't know.
If not, then it's a false narrative.
But I see that, regardless, I see this scene all the time,
you know, at Build Space, while you guys are here.
You guys are constantly showing each other stuff.
So again, maybe you're not at this point yet
where you've got this level of kind of help that you found,
but this counts.
So you're starting somewhere, correct?
And it's very important to realize.
So a lot of you are here at this point
where you're asking for help like this in small ways,
but how can we improve on how we ask for help?
How can we ask better questions?
How can we, yeah, kind of essentially,
yeah, ask in a really pointed way,
push their work forward by asking others for help so we don't have to play the game solo.
So let's go through, I want to go through some ways. Number one, go direct. This is the most
obvious thing I can possibly say, which is if there is someone out there that can help you,
you should go ask them. And let me kind of give you a simple framework to kind of follow there.
Take something very small you're trying to get good at and that you need help on. Maybe it's,
I don't know, something technical.
Maybe it's short form content.
Maybe it's, I think Derek Declan today
was talking about Facebook ads.
Where are they at?
Yeah, you were talking about Facebook ads.
Maybe you wanna get good at Facebook ads.
Something small you're trying to get good at, right?
Okay, now find the person that's two to three steps ahead
of whatever, ahead of you at that thing.
They don't have to be experts at that thing,
but they're ahead of you for sure.
And just have that direct ask.
That's like the simplest thing you can possibly do.
You're not trying to find people that are gonna
like save your project or save your life.
You're trying to find people that are gonna like
help you in a very pointed way.
And you should know what you want help on.
So again, short-forward content,
maybe it's a developer thing, whatever.
I did this last week.
Last week I got back into coding land with Alec
and I was like, all right, I have no idea
how to build an AI app these days.
I literally have zero clue.
I have not made a single AI app since 2019 or 2021.
So what do I do?
I get in a call with Naveed.
Naveed is from SF1.
He built an AI app, right?
I get in a call with Sharif.
There's Sharif, me, and Stavan.
Last week, this is Tuesday,
and we just asked Sharif on a whiteboard,
how do you build this?
And you know, have him go through it step by step.
So again, we know these people are ahead of us.
So there's no shame in that.
We just ask for help.
So for most of you, and for most of you,
Those that can help you are always a DMOA.
Generally, I believe that.
Because again, you're looking for people
two or three steps away from you,
not like 20 steps away from you.
Like, if you're a musician today
and you try to reach out to Skrillex, pretty hard, right?
But if you try to reach out to another artist
that's maybe a bit smaller, maybe 10% the size,
a little easier.
I wanna give an example.
Where's Samia?
Samia, what's this guy's name?
Tal Winder.
Tal Winder.
So Samia hits me up on email and says,
you know, Farza, do you ever connect with Telewinder?
And I was like, hey, yo, man, definitely not.
But what I did was I just went to his Instagram.
At this point, let's see,
you felt like this guy could help you, right?
Can I help your sound a little bit?
And he's based in California?
Cool, so amazing.
Swami has identified someone
that can potentially help him on his journey,
which is fucking beautiful.
That's a shout out to you for even finding someone.
That's the hardest part sometimes.
Great, so now we have a couple of options.
We can message him here.
273k followers, I don't know, what do you think?
Pretty tough?
Pretty tough.
Pretty tough.
So what do I do?
I click this guy's website.
Okay, cool, here's his website.
I found his Twitter.
Turns out he has Andrew Falls on Twitter.
His DMs are open and he last tweeted 10 days ago
or whatever, it's 14 days ago.
All right, that's already a potential in, you know?
And then we can keep going and keep trying to find
his email or other avenues to him.
But again, this guy is so small in the grand scheme of things.
And I hope that, I know this may seem like a big personality
or like a hard person you're in touch with,
but at the end of the day, there is a path to them.
And I think this person is totally someone
you can reach out to.
And if this person doesn't respond, that's fine.
Let's find someone a little bit smaller
that's still ahead of you, right?
But again, it may not seem obvious
on how this guy, how you can talk to this guy,
but you gotta do some digging.
You gotta do some work on your own, right?
Kind of find them, get to them.
Okay, cool, so that's my first thing.
Just go direct, find the people ahead of you,
a little bit ahead of you,
and a very specific aspect of the work,
and then kind of go from there.
Yeah?
I think if you go back a couple slides to his website,
Yes.
It says, my music will help me find my people,
so even you can leverage that as a point in common.
Like, hey, you have this on your website,
and I need this help.
I don't know if that's the way.
Yeah, no, I think we can talk more about
in a different time on how you would actually format the message.
But at the end of the day, yeah, great observation,
I didn't even notice, my music will help me find my people.
Holy shit, this guy's trying to find you, Samia.
Great, like, you should talk about that,
you should get to him.
That's so funny, I didn't even read that, great, great catch.
My second kind of like, I wouldn't say tip,
but it's just like a kind of more pointed way to ask for help.
This is my favorite way to ask for help,
is to open yourself up for help
and let others track your journey.
So what does that mean?
One second, see what is this slide?
Oh yeah, okay, so here.
Here is where you're actually going directly to people
and asking them for help, right?
Like you're literally reaching out to them.
In this case, Soumya would directly reach out to this artist
that could potentially help him.
Or in this case, I'm directly reaching out to my buddies
and asking them for help, right?
But I think what's also interesting
is those who will reach out to you
to just help you naturally.
How can you make that happen?
Because in my experience, those are the people
that have become my greatest allies
and the people that have stuck around in my life for longest.
And what's obvious here is if you want someone to help you,
you have to give them the opportunity.
They have to know that you need help
or that you are even wanting help.
Generally today, if I look up a lot of your guys' work,
a lot of your socials, a lot of your profiles,
it's not really obvious what you need help with, actually,
to be honest.
You wanna make it hyper, hyper obvious
that you need help and why and from who, et cetera, right?
And let me kind of paint the picture.
For me, again, I told you earlier,
I did this with a newsletter.
I knew if I'd grinded a newsletter for four years,
that something good would happen.
Particularly what would happen is,
I'd give more opportunity for people to help me, right?
Through a simple reply.
So again, Sean, earlier,
I gave him the opportunity to even reply.
Otherwise, if I never sent that email,
dude, Sean's not gonna talk to me.
Like, there's no reason, right?
So again, Sean, I pop up in his inbox,
he's like, all right, this far as a kid, back at it again,
let's see what he's up to.
Reads it and then replies, right?
So I gave him the opportunity.
And again, newsletter worked for me,
because I love writing.
I've always loved writing.
And, or not always love writing,
but it's always been an interest.
And that worked for me.
Other things that I've tried,
sometimes I literally just write one-page Google Docs,
and then I send them to people that I want help,
or I just post them online,
or I email them out to people that I think could help me.
Another option, right?
I've actually asked,
how many of you have written a one-page doc for me?
I'm just curious.
James, you want to send, I think one more?
Adam as well, he has three people.
That helped me a lot because I read your doc
and I immediately, like in two minutes,
understand what's their story, where are they at,
what's their problem, what do they need help with,
how can I help, you know?
Like instantly, I'm not sitting there
for a 45 minute conversation trying to get it out of you.
You know, you just give it to me straight.
So again, these are two things that work for me,
but let's talk about some other examples.
This is a kid, I don't know where he actually,
I found out about him, but his name's,
oh what, you know?
I know him.
TKS.
TKS.
Ah, TKS.
So this is Ayaan, and I don't know,
one day he emails me, and he's like,
hey, Parza, can I put you on my weekly newsletter
where I send out vlogs, or my weekly vlog letter thing,
whatever it is.
And yeah, he just sends out these vlogs every single month,
and he sends them out, like, really every month.
And it's a two minute video where he talks about
what he did that month.
Amazing, it works for him,
cause he likes doing it in front of the camera,
he's vocally pretty good, it works.
And I actually watch these every time.
I've been watching him for like a year now,
and I just, I've never talked to him.
I've sent him maybe five messages,
but I always like reply, I'm like, hey Ayan,
like, how are you doing this?
Do you need help with that?
And I'm kind of always like,
he gives me the opportunity to help him.
You know, that's the most important thing.
Another example, this is Nishu and Stavan.
So Nishu will literally just send Stavan
like full on vlogs and essays about how his stuff is going.
Right, like directly.
And Stavan sometimes replies,
Someone's stavan sometimes doesn't.
And I think what's important is like,
Nishu is giving the opportunity for stavan to even reply.
Right?
Like not many people are gonna go out
and literally make little videos like this.
You know?
I have another person who,
I'm not sure what, just like a buddy at this point,
but he about every like once a month
sends me like a five minute voice note.
About, he's updating me about his work, his life,
and how he feels.
And I have no pressure to reply,
but that's how he keeps me updated.
I think he sends those out to 20 people every month.
So again, I reply to those, I help them out.
But this is another way.
Maybe you're more comfortable with something like this.
It's more private.
I think that this will always hold people back
from doing this.
You'll always be like, damn,
do I really wanna tell the world or this person
that I've been failing for six weeks straight?
Or do I really wanna tell the world or this person
that things aren't going as great as it could be going.
I think that's actually pretty hard,
but you'll quickly realize, what I learned at least,
is that nobody cares about me.
I'm just a really small fish, to be honest.
And damn, no one's gonna be thinking this.
It's just in my head, but yeah.
So I've had that thought before, for sure,
but I've also had another thought that
is just like what I'm doing is insignificant.
And there's no reason that I shouldn't even put something out.
It's like, literally no one should care about it.
For sure, you know, if we go back to that one slide
where I'm talking about the fan theory of Death Note,
I'm telling you, nobody gives a shit about that one fan theory
except me.
Huh?
There's a stack.
Again, they're not on my email list.
It's more like, yeah, even if something's so insignificant,
it was still cool to you.
So like at least get someone the opportunity
to decide for themselves if it's insignificant, you know?
I think that helps a lot.
On that Death Note email, by the way, someone did reply.
And it was just like a funny, like,
that was interesting, you know, type of reply.
We can pull it up after this.
But yeah, turns out even someone found that interesting.
So, I don't know, my philosophy has always been,
let the other person decide whether or not
this is worth their time.
You just be honest, you just be like,
be real with what you think is cool.
And yeah, the more you put yourself out there,
your struggles, not just the more you put yourself out there,
because the whole world, I want to be very clear about this.
Kind of like going online and just talking about your wins
doesn't do much.
Like, I just made $100.
You know, people who post stuff like that all the time,
like, I just made $100, now I made $500,
now I'm making $1 million.
It's like, well, it's cool, but that doesn't give me a place,
that doesn't help me understand where I can help you.
All right?
Where are you struggling?
You know, like, where are you flopping?
What's the last thing that you tried that didn't work?
What'd you learn?
You know, like, how are you getting these thoughts out there?
Right now, a lot of you probably aren't,
but again, it's up to you how you can do it.
Maybe it looks like this with a single person.
Maybe it looks like this with like 20 people.
It really is up to you
and what you kind of feel best doing.
Yeah.
I feel like, and this, we have talked about this before as well.
Like, we end up going into this loop
of trying to feel legit in public.
Yup.
And like making a brand out of ourselves
and like comparing ourselves to like the top artists
or the top like builders in the world that we see.
Yeah.
So we don't put our struggles and stuff out there.
We only put our awards and achievements.
Yeah, yeah.
Out there to just like make an image.
For sure.
Sort.
Yeah, yeah, I mean, pretty much, yeah.
I mean, that people do that.
I think that it's just up to you to decide if you want to do that.
Do you want to just put yourself out there and just be seen by the world as great?
Is that your goal, actually?
Do you really care?
Again, for me, I just never cared.
I never actually...
It never burned me.
It's not that I didn't care about what the world thought of what I was doing.
It's just that I never got burned from it.
To this day, I've never been burned by putting my struggles out there.
In fact, it makes people have more empathy with me,
sympathize with me.
And I think that's kind of interesting too.
So, yeah, again, you don't have to be public about this.
This is whatever you're comfortable with.
Like, Nishu just texts Stava.
I have another guy that just texts me a voice note
once in a month, so it's kind of up to you, actually.
There should be that group of people that are ahead of you,
maybe five people, 10 people, whatever it is,
maybe one person that you feel like you can kind of depend on.
That will not judge you.
I think that's pretty hard too.
But yeah.
This might be a niche question, but I usually like to post this kind of, like, post the
struggles on Twitter.
Yeah.
And just be open on Twitter.
But a lot of my sales for my course came from Twitter.
And so part of me feels a little weird to be, like, honest about the course experience
or just, like, post behind the scenes of it now that those people have been the people
I've sold to.
So how does that dynamic change when you're, like, selling to the people that you're all
I just feel like that the fear of being judged
is in a great place to make decisions from.
Just who gives a fuck?
Like, it's not gonna buy it, they're not gonna buy it, you know?
I don't know, easier said than done,
but for me, I just don't care.
Like, okay, like, then that means they're not gonna buy it from me.
All right, we'll find someone else.
Should be okay, but again, easier said than done.
And the last thing, and probably the hardest thing,
is be the type of person people want to help.
I have a question.
How many of you here have asked a teammate for help or feedback?
You've reached out to us.
Almost everyone.
Okay, cool.
Follow-up question, and please be hyper-honest.
How many of you came back within a day or two and then showed them the result?
Like you showed it to them, like literally on your phone or your laptop.
Okay, one.
Yeah, cool.
Makes sense.
Most of you didn't do it.
Some of you did.
Shout out.
Good stuff.
Why is that important?
But pretty much you have to think about things
from the perspective of the person helping you.
Let's just say it's one of us, right,
who work at BuildSpace.
Again, you kinda gotta make it interesting for even us.
Like are we helping you out of the goodness of our heart?
Are we helping you because it's our job?
Are we helping you just because we wanna help you?
That would be the best reason, right?
So again, when even like you do something like this,
when you ask someone for feedback,
or you ask someone to help you with something,
and they helped you, you should be back within,
like, at minimum an hour, and at maximum a day,
showing them how it went.
For example, many of you have helped me,
have asked me for advice on your TikToks, or your shorts,
and I give you my five to 10 minutes of advice,
and my take, all right?
But then, no one's come back to me showing me the result.
Like, not a single one who's asked me for help.
What's up with that?
Like, now I don't really feel like helping you after,
Or I have less of an incentive because I'm like, oh, here they are, back again, asking
me to help with another thing.
I don't even know how that last thing went.
Like, are they just going to kind of waste my time again here?
You know, like that's kind of a thought going through my head.
And to kind of stack that up 10, 15 times, all of a sudden, you're a really hard person
to help, you know?
And how do you solve that?
Very simple.
Like, Farza, you gave me this feedback.
I tried it.
Here was the result.
You know, so easy.
So if you ask someone for help, remember you have a responsibility to actually go back
to them and update them.
Because if you don't, they're going to be like, uh, so where'd they go?
And then it's just, it's not fun.
It's just not fun, basically.
So I think it's worth asking some questions even to yourself internally right now.
Is it a pain to help you?
Like honestly, like are you, when you ask for help, do you feel like you're kind of
of getting the person to get out of their way and it's like you're like just tugging them aside and
being like yo help me you know or like is it a pain to help you like how do you ask for help
how do you pull people aside how do you make time this sort of stuff right just simplest first
question is it a pain to help you and again you kind of all know the answer internally whatever
it is uh do you make it simple to understand your problems am i sitting there for 20 minutes just
just trying to understand whatever it is
you're trying to ask me,
or do you ask me in the first 60 seconds?
Generally, we're pretty nice here,
and we'll be pretty patient,
and we'll take time to understand your problem.
But most of the world, not so much.
They'll be like, wow, I really don't have 20 minutes
to spend going through this person's life
and figuring out their deepest, darkest problems.
I gotta go, you know, I gotta, it's time to go, you know?
So just make it simple to understand your problems.
Like do you actually?
And a lot of you, again, you have an answer.
Do you drain the person helping you?
This is, probably many of you have not asked this question.
You ask us for a lot of help.
You probably ask other people for a lot of help.
Are you draining us?
Was it energizing to help you?
Or did it feel like, just like a chore?
You know, how can it not feel like a chore?
You know, if you ask Josh for help on a video,
how can it, what does Josh want?
What does Josh want to see?
Josh probably wants to see you succeed.
So, succeed, and then show Josh.
And if you didn't succeed, that's fine, still show Josh.
Because then that's gonna energize whoever you're helping.
And I think this is the last one.
Does the person helping you feel like
they're seeing the fruits, right?
Most of the time, the people that will help you the most
are the ones that are down to invest in you
over months and years.
And we'll get into that relationship in a sec.
But for that to happen, they really gotta see
And they really gotta see that something is happening, you know?
Otherwise it really does get tiring.
Again, if one of you asks me for kind of my take 20 days in a row and then 20 days later
you're in the same place, I'm not annoyed, you know?
Generally people won't be annoyed, but I'll just be like, oh man, like I don't really
feel like expending the energy now to like help them.
And that's not a good place to be, right?
Let's just say the opposite.
say you talked me for 20 days in a row and you tried you kind of updated me for
20 days in a row as well right you didn't just do the same thing that you
would have done anyways you actually were like oh far as I like check this
out you mentioned doing this I tried it out here's what happened let's see let's
see do that for 20 days in a row with me all right I will be your biggest fan
like I will do everything and anything to help you like win in life right
because it's like oh my god like they are actually like I'm actually helping
and that feels great and it sounds like they're also enjoying working with me.
Great. It's essentially like we're friends now. Cool. And I think that'd be
that's like the best place to get to. And I think when you think about help,
don't think of help as a one-off request like ever where it's like what do you
think about this and then leave you know or like what do you think about this
tweet and then leave. It's like it's not that. It's actually like a very long-term
relationship with the person that's helping you. Of course it may start with
something small, which is like,
what do you think about this tweet?
Great.
And then maybe in two days,
you show me how that tweet went.
And then you show me more.
Now we're talking more about your Twitter.
Now we're talking about your other socials.
And now it turns out we've been talking
for three to six months.
And we've been helping each other
for three to six months.
That's an example of how you can,
a one-off request can turn into something a lot longer.
But again, I think a lot of people think about
asking for help as a one-off.
And like, let's hop on a quick call.
You know, like I get these times, I guess,
I'm also guilty of sending those types of emails to people
back when I was like, in college especially,
where I was like, hey, let's hop on a call.
I think you're interesting.
It's like, well, I don't know.
Who are you?
So, yes.
So somebody had a question about that.
Some of the people that I, like, that are ahead of me
that I ask for help, I'll have periods of my life
where I'm consistently talking to them.
like once every week or once every two weeks or something like that.
Yep, yep.
And then there's other periods where it goes like years and I'll like talk to them
once every three months or so.
Yeah, yeah.
And those feel like after it gets to the point where the interactions are more
cut out, it feels more like one off.
So is that what you're classifying as one off or do you mean just like talking to
the person one time on one call?
I think one off is more talking to the person one time on one call.
I think your situation is, it sounds like it was a good relationship.
you got what you wanted out of it and you moved on with life.
You know, I think that's okay.
We have these, I'll talk about one relationship like that
I have like with a person right now.
But I think one off is, like you wanna kinda reduce
one offs in the sense of like, I'll give you a perfect
example of a one off, right?
Where it's like, I gotta go back to like the TikTok example.
A lot of you ask me for TikTok advice constantly, right?
And I don't know why, I've never made a TikTok
personally myself, so take that as you will.
But again, if you keep returning to a person with one-off requests and you don't tell them how the previous requests went,
it's just like a one-off, every conversation is a new thread.
And you want to kind of keep one big old thread, you know?
You're writing a book with them. You're not writing like...
Some of you are writing a new book every time I talk to you and it's like, okay, let's not do that.
It's very hard on the person that's helping you.
Remember, you will never annoy a person with results,
no matter good, no matter bad, ever.
Like, no one's ever gonna be mad
that you did something and then it didn't work.
They're just happy that you even tried.
Remember that.
I wanna give one final story.
Some of you already know this guy.
I've talked about this guy a bunch,
but this is Furcon.
He runs Founders Inc.
And this man single-handedly has changed my life
probably like 10 times.
Not even exaggerating.
It's ridiculous.
And I want to talk a little bit about how it started,
how it kind of, like, how I put in a lot of effort
to kind of make the relationship work,
and how it worked out for me over a very long period.
And it also was really fun for him.
First of all, I wrote this blog post in 2018?
January 2018.
A long blog post about how I did
this deep learning thing, all right?
It goes kind of mini-viral.
I got like 1.4K of claps there,
whatever that means on Medium.
if you remember Medium, and I got a 1.4K collapse,
and Furkan was one of the people who read this, right?
Someone I posted on Twitter, or on Reddit,
and Furkan read it on Reddit.
So Furkan knew me actually from this,
but we never talked.
From there, I have my buddy Sharif,
who did the talk here.
In 2018, Sharif messaged me this.
He says, I would talk to Furkan
because he's so close to UNSF.
This dude is like the Elon Musk of video game streaming.
whatever that means.
But back then, this was really exciting for me and Sharif.
So again, Sharif knew him from another thing.
And then I just messaged Furkan.
I DM him on Twitter.
I'm like, hey man, thanks for the follow.
My boy Salmon has been talking a bunch about you lately.
Super glad you're helping his team.
I'm not even asking for anything.
I'm just like, hey man, thanks.
And I'm glad that you're working with my friends.
And then he essentially, Furkan follows up.
You know, he's like, I think he mentioned you're in SF.
Fucking two days later, we're meeting up, you know?
And he offers me dinner at his office,
where his chef comes and cooks for us.
It was pretty awesome.
So again, this is actually how it started.
Like this is like the, I just ripped it straight from Twitter.
And this just goes on and on, to be honest with you.
Like, we just keep on talking every single week.
It starts to get like, I can go through like 50 messages
looks just like this where it's like us saying you want to talk and then him
saying I'm around at this time you know constantly and you know I was honestly
kind of relentless I was a yeah I was kind of relentless I didn't have any
like I didn't think of I didn't think too much about annoying him because I
kind of just felt like if I was annoying him he'd tell me so great we just kind of
keep asking for kind of things from him and then from there we actually
I actually kept a weekly chat for every week for almost three years.
Yeah, like every week for three years.
Now, how did that happen? What were those calls?
Very simple. Every week, I think it was like Wednesday nights usually,
Furkan would call me, we would screen share,
and I would show him what I did that week, and he would be like,
this XYZ thing you're doing is just stupid, stop doing that, try this new thing.
And he would give me his take.
I would then try some new stuff.
I would also kind of listen to his takes and I would spend another week and again
We would come back to that again
So every week was actually really fun because for Furkan think about it from his point of view
He is like seeing some random dude go off and explore ideas that he himself is interested in
So for Furkan, it was just like oh man, like let's just see what happens, you know, like I'm just curious
And yeah, that was great. That was like the initial thing that kind of kept us kept us going for in the early days
And then yeah after that we just kept on talking
And I literally, I want to kind of be clear, I told this man everything.
Everything.
I told him about my emotional breakdowns, I told him about my horrible losses, my greatest
wins.
And I think my goal is always to be like, how can I be the type of person I would want
to help?
Because I know that as far as I'm like, I ask a lot out of folks generally.
But how can I make that a kind of like a, how can I make that fun for the person at
least?
feel like, oh fuck, I have to hop on a Zoom call with Farza again. God damn it. I really don't
want to do this. You know, like that shouldn't be the feeling. You should be like, oh shit, let's go.
Like, what's Farza cooking this week? You know, I think that was usually the feeling.
Maybe Furkan would say different, but maybe we can bring him in and we can have him tell us if
this is true or not. And again, I want to be, like I'm saying, I shared everything with him.
I was at one point sharing how my mom and dad were freaking out about me moving to San Francisco
and he was giving me advice around how to deal with my parents.
At one point, by the way, I'm a one-man company for years.
I bring Furcon into my Slack channel.
It's just me and Furcon in Slack.
And he's my team, and I would just keep on updating him
every single day, multiple times a day,
tagging him with ideas that I had
or new kind of experiments that I was running.
So it was very relentless, and it was very hands-on,
And I give them a lot of opportunity to help me.
That was the most important thing.
For example, this was an idea that I had.
You don't have to read it, but summarized is,
I was like, oh, what if you could learn about
racing drones at your home school?
Racing drones are pretty fun.
Kids these days are into robots.
What if we did this thing where we helped people make
drone racing scenes alongside their home school
in Florida.
Again, very specific, very niche,
but I remember he replied to this like,
please stop thinking about this.
Like, stop.
Like, whatever you're doing, stop.
Like, keep doing the thing that you told me
about the other week.
And then again, like, these sorts of interactions
helped a lot, and he felt like a partner, you know,
all the time, despite the fact that he wasn't actually
literally working with me on stuff.
And then again, all the way down to the biggest wins.
This was my diary from 2020.
I get into YC, which was a big deal.
And then I got to share that one with him, right?
Because I'm pretty solo in my life, right?
For the most part.
I talked, I think I started this talk earlier
sharing with you guys that I didn't have anybody to help me.
Didn't have anyone that I could talk to about this stuff.
Finally, I had someone to talk to.
I could even share with someone
that I got into Y Combinator
because my parents aren't going to care.
My cousins and brothers aren't going to care.
They don't even know what that is.
But hey, Furkan cares and that was fun.
It was fun to just share that with him, right?
And so in a weird way, I've learned
that no one actually wants to help you.
Like nobody.
Like no one goes out and be like, I wanna help Kieran,
I wanna help James, you know, no one does that.
And when they do do that,
it actually ends up being kinda weird.
So maybe like, stay away from those people
that are like, I can help you, you know?
It's like, okay man, all right, shit, okay, maybe.
Or I can be your mentor, it's like, all right, dude, bet.
Bet, okay.
Honestly, yeah, no one seeks to help you,
it just kinda happens.
Again, I showed you the Sean story,
I showed you the Furcon story,
I showed you the story with a bunch of other,
I showed you a bunch of other stories.
This just kinda happens and you have to make,
you have to create an environment for it to have happened.
Otherwise it won't.
And yeah, over time what's beautiful about this
is you kinda just become good friends.
Like at this point, Furcon's not my mentor.
Like that's just kinda weird.
He's more like a brother, more like a friend, right?
But that just kinda happened over many, many years,
to be honest.
And yeah, that's pretty cool.
It's pretty cool.
So again, to kind of end here,
I'm gonna take questions.
This doesn't need to be a solo player mission.
Please don't make it like that.
I know some of you think that only you can solve your problems,
but please open your brains up to thinking who can potentially help you.
Start simple today. Ask for help.
And ask for help in the ways that I'm telling you
that you may have learned about through this lecture here today.
You know, maybe ask better questions.
Maybe I don't maybe it's stop asking me about your 10th tick-tock
Maybe ask me questions like this that are like more interesting like farza
Where do you think I'm flopping be honest with you?
Where do you think I'm a flop like where do you think I'm failing?
Do you really I'm gonna be anybody here in six weeks like be realistic with me like give me the harsh answer
And I'll give you the harsh answer if you want me harsh
I'll also give you the nice answer if you want to be nice far as you know
What am I doing really well? How can I be better at that?
I would love these questions.
I'm sure a lot of the team would love these questions.
Because if we're watching you,
we kind of have a sense of what you are doing well,
what could be better.
Hey, how can I improve doing XYZ?
Maybe that's an interesting question to ask as well
to a teammate, to a friend, to anybody, right?
To even each other.
These are interesting questions to just ask each other.
I know some of you are kind of friends at this point.
And so like, maybe you won't give each other
harsh realities but i hope that you all can always be honest with each other um and if someone asks
you this question within built space that you would answer honestly but i know it's hard um and
yeah or hey reach out to someone some four to five steps ahead of you you got nothing you got nothing
to lose i remember i uh i would reach out to the snapchat ceo in 2016 because i thought that guy
was i mean as you can tell i loved snapchat like for years so i was like my dream was to meet evan
spiegel you know like snapchat ceo because i thought he was the sickest guy ever and i would
I would email him once a month forever,
and eventually I got an email back saying,
hey, I'm Evan's assistant, you can apply for your internship.
And I was just like, all right, cool, thank you,
I got a response, you know, after like years.
Don't do that, you know, maybe reach out to someone
that's a little bit closer to your kind of radius.
And yeah, be honest always, be clear with your requests,
and most importantly, know where you need help.
That's the most important thing.
You can't be helped unless you even know what you need help on.
And yeah, that's the most important thing.
And that's it.
Any questions?
Yeah, yeah.
Do you have some thoughts on like taking advice?
Because sometimes when you talk to a lot of people, you get a lot of advice.
And sometimes you also get advice on stuff where maybe you don't think any help on.
Yeah.
Like do you have some tips on that?
For sure, for sure.
Very hiring.
Yeah, yeah.
I think I talked about the LeBron some a little bit today actually.
it's like everyone, like at BuildSpace especially, I especially and none of the teammates are
trying to give you advice.
And you should generally be wary of people giving you advice.
It's like you should always just take the other person's take.
And then from there, decide, do I want to go with that or do I not want to go with that?
It's just up to you.
And that's actually pretty hard because you have to kind of internalize what they're talking
about and decide for yourself.
But yeah, I would never straight follow anybody's advice ever.
You should kind of feel like you agree with it, you should feel like it makes sense, and
then go for it.
Again, for example, if I sit here and tell you, James, this thing you're working on,
I don't know, maybe you should go, I don't know, start a concrete company.
And I give you all the reasons why you start a concrete company.
At the end of the day, that's my take.
So always take things as takes.
Be very wary of advice, I've learned at least.
Yes?
If you're reaching out to people who can't accept them,
do you recommend that friends build a relationship with them,
or is it just asking them to help you get out?
That's a good question.
It depends.
If you literally don't know them, and they seem like,
for example, I think Samia's example.
This guy seems big enough, let's go back to him.
Holy shit.
This guy seems big enough where he probably gets
a lot of people hitting him up, I'm guessing.
Right?
So from this guy, I would just honestly try both.
Like, I would always start with the simple like,
hey, my name is X, and this is where I'm at,
and I really love your stuff,
and I feel like I would appreciate if you would help me
with this specific problem I have,
because I feel like you've done it before.
And if you haven't, that's cool.
I think at the end of the day,
most people are down to help people
that they see themselves in, right?
So with this sort of person,
It's like I would first see if you respond something like that, and if that doesn't work, then just stay following up.
There's no problem, you know?
Like, maybe they drop a song and then they left you on red.
I love your latest song, you know? Something as simple as that.
That's happened to me many times where I'm trying to get in touch with someone and they leave me on red
because they're a big personality, but I'm just like relentless.
I'm like, love your song, blah blah blah.
Can I show you guys an example of this actually?
It's actually maybe kind of embarrassing.
It's actually very embarrassing.
Who remembers Zane, the Smash Brothers player?
You all remember him?
Okay, I talked about him.
For the longest time, I really wanted to help this guy with his content.
I wanted to help him, so that's already red flag.
But also, I just felt like I really wanted it to get deep into the Smash Brothers scene anyways,
and I felt like he could help me with that.
Because I wanted to do fun stuff like,
I wanted to potentially perhaps like commentate
at Super Smash Brothers events.
I thought that'd be awesome, right?
And I want to kind of show you here how badly this can go
and how kind of shameless I really am.
This is my thread with him.
Please look at the dates. Feel free.
November.
December.
What's the last week?
February 18th, 2024.
Now, if I can do this,
I honestly believe that you guys can do anything.
Thanks, man.
See, I started in 2017, right?
Yeah, this is why I didn't stick you.
Again, I think it's like that level of like relentlessness and just shamelessness that you kind of need sometimes.
Now honestly, that may have started getting kind of annoying, but honestly, I really was just being like, yo, great work.
You know, I really was, like truly.
Huh?
Spaced it out really well.
Spaced it out really well.
It wasn't weird.
Only every four months, you know?
But no, I had that sort of interaction with like hundreds of people on the internet, because most people will never reply.
And I know that because I'm also that guy that may never reply to a person who shows that to me
So I know how hard it is therefore you'll catch me in there 20 times before I say okay
Maybe the same maybe this isn't maybe this isn't it, you know, so
Responding to people that want to reach out for help because I got like couple people sending me messages and yeah
I want to help or like your project school, but how would you like so usually my answer is like okay, but how can you help?
or what's your thing or like how would you like manage those people?
You're saying people want to help you?
Yeah.
I'll just- my always thing where- how many of you are looking for like potential partners for your projects,
whoever you're working on? I'm curious.
Yeah, interesting. You for sure.
It's very simple. Whenever- if you're- if you're ever looking for someone who can help you,
or who you're trying to help, um, mostly people that are trying to help you,
Like you're trying to find someone to essentially take your project to the next level, or maybe, in this case, maybe be an engineer or something.
Yeah, honestly, just do you like talking to them?
It's like the most important thing. Again, a call within 30 minutes. Do you like talking to them?
If you do, then you should keep talking to them.
Same thing with this. Like if Samia reaches out to Thalwinder, the artist, and Thalwinder ends up being like a kind of weird guy, not that fun to talk to.
talk to, I don't know.
Samya, you have no reason to keep talking to them.
Same with Furkan.
If Furkan was not that fun to talk to day one,
I'm not trying to talk to Furkan more.
I'm like, okay, I'm good.
Next.
So, it's okay.
Sometimes that happens.
You should kind of trust your gut.
Definitely don't talk to people just because
you want help from them and you don't enjoy talking to them.
That's like the worst.
Very exhausting.
Yeah.
Just wanna share something quick.
There have been like four to five people
who have reached out to me who are good
what they're doing yep who were just like hey we we want to help you or whatever and since then
i don't feel that i have used their help but i just like talking to them so we interact every
once in a while on a call or like in a meeting but i think there would be some really perfect time
in the future when all those five people yeah are going to have the perfect opportunity to help me
and it's all gonna come together.
No, that's beautiful.
I have a very similar philosophy with another person,
with this guy.
Where is he?
Sorry, one sec, let me just plug in.
But overall, it's like, I agree.
That's actually a good way to think about it.
You're trying to keep people around in your life
because you like having them around mostly, right?
But also because, hey, maybe something
can pan out in the future.
And it's like a symbiotic relationship
versus like just you polling.
Me and Shreve are kind of funny
because we always joke that when we're 35,
we'll start a company together.
And that's kind of become like very serious.
It's become like a serious meme.
But it's funny because it's like,
we're so down to keep on pushing each other all the time
as friends and as like partners,
because we want to kind of,
we want to kind of see each other succeed, you know?
So yeah.
And I have a lot of partners like that in my life, you know?
Just like you.
So it's good to have these types of people around, you know?
For me, it's the team.
Kind of Jeff, Stubb, and Alec.
These guys, they keep pushing me, you know?
So, yeah.
Last question.
Adil.
I don't know a question.
Can I tell a story?
A story?
I've been talking about how to ask help, right?
Tell your story, Adil.
Let's go.
You're not even part of SF2.
Oh, yeah.
I did SF1, by the way.
I was talking to another SF1 dude, one of my buddies.
Sous-Sumi.
Okay.
And he's asking me for all this help at the startup.
And I'm trying to just listen.
I'm not offering help or anything.
He's just trying to get my take.
And in the corner, we're in the gaming room, I think.
And Furkan and Shreep are just playing Smash.
And I keep telling Supi, I'm like, why are you asking me for help?
Furkan and Shreep are right there.
He's like, oh, they're busy.
I'm not playing Smash.
They're playing Smash.
And it's just like, I don't know.
For me, that was more on to not be scared of asking for help.
Yeah, while we're talking, they're like listening to both of us. Yeah, and every time they like pause the game
Like make menu select and for a copy like actually don't want to do that
You want to like do this and like just like so he's like yeah busy. Yeah, really
They're like so interested in sui's problem that they like actually yeah
They're like so directly clickable like what he wants and he's like scared to talk
Yeah, yeah for context Subhash was SF1 very
Great great hacker very shy guy and he would be scared to even ask Amit for a new
code to the building if it expired. So it's like, it's like yeah, it's yeah it's
tough you have to understand that that that's like where you got you got to
like find something within yourself to be like it's alright like I'm not gonna
ruin the other person's life by asking for help. Worst case they say no. I think
that's hard to get your head around but as you do it enough it becomes real.
Cool.
My moral of the story was like, yo, that was a great moral though.
Oh yeah?
My moral of the story was like, yo, people like, that's what I've done before,
but really want to be involved with people
who are doing it right now.
You said earlier, but like,
WorkOn's literally pausing the game to help this kid.
You know?
They truly love the other people.
They'll be happy to help.
Cool.
All right, cool, thanks.
