All right. We good, Josh? Cool. Welcome. I guess this is the third class, but we like to start
with zero. So welcome to DMW class 002. Design 101. I preface it with a kinda because I've done
this now half a dozen times and I've changed a lot of it for this time because I wanted it to
be more focused to you guys. I look around and I've talked to almost all of you and there's a
few faces that I still need to get to but we'll get there. So yeah this talk all I want to do is
kind of just recap what Design 101 is. I'll give you the fundamentals. Again a lot of you guys have
already gone through that through any of our past videos. Maybe we did that in nights and weekends
season four for one of the sections. So, but irrespective of what you're working on, you can
take these principles and start applying them today. And that's my goal. And that's why I don't
kind of dive too deep into the tools. I'd rather more want you guys to focus on
the lessons and concepts and start just using them day one. Also,
when I was going through the review of some of the things that you guys shipped this week,
there was a lot that kind of like I kept coming back to and even in the conversations I had with
you. So there's a few mental models there too and we'll cover them. So cool, welcome.
So what is design?
Anyone wanna start off with what they think design is?
Aesthetic.
Okay, aesthetic.
Like the experience that you go through
and what do you think happens to them?
The entire experience the user goes through, okay.
I think it's how people engage with
with and experience in such a,
and do something very properly.
Yeah.
How does someone interact with what they're doing?
Yeah.
How intentional choices do they convey to you?
Yeah.
So it's like all of the above, right?
But the one that I kind of associate myself to,
and just for context, I grew up in a family of designers,
So my mom and dad are both designers.
And ever since a very young age,
like it was instilled in me that it's the holistic experience
that you can provide to someone end to end,
no matter what.
And they designed houses, communities,
things of that, like physical spaces.
But the amount of detail they showed
to like every single meticulous thing that they crafted,
that kind of like tells you
that it's not just making it look beautiful.
It should also be usable.
and we'll kind of cover a lot of those things today.
So yeah, it's not just what it looks and feels like,
it's how it actually works as a whole.
So this is what you can boil it down to in many ways, right?
The best designs are one, useful,
two, usable, and three, beautiful, right?
And there's weightage associated to each of them,
but by itself, it's kind of like,
it's still incomplete, right?
You can have a design that's just useful,
but hey, maybe it's not that usable.
Hey, maybe it's not that aesthetically pleasing to look at.
So all three of them,
it's kind of like the holy trinity of design
that you have to keep in mind.
But first and foremost, before you actually,
there is a process to this,
you have to start with it being useful.
It should solve a problem for the user
and it should meet a need for them.
And this can, again, be connected back to ideas
you guys are building and what problem is it solving,
what need is it solving for the end user.
And if it's not useful,
it does not matter how usable or beautiful it is.
So you have to just nail that part first.
Once you have that, then,
well, it's pretty simple from then on, right?
Just make it usable.
A person should not have to work a lot
in order for them to understand what this is.
Like who's in DaVinci code?
Yeah, they're not here to solve a fucking puzzle
or mystery, right?
They just wanna, they found something useful,
now they just wanna use it.
Do not make them work extremely hard
to figure out how they need to interact with it
and things of that nature.
And a lot of the things that I talk about
may be taken into context of like
actual web design or app design,
but it can be applied to everything.
So think about how usability applies to you
and your domain, whether you're making music or videos
or films or art.
All of these things are extremely important
in every single domain.
And if it's difficult to use, they'll just churn NBC.
That the easiest is you can just look at your analytics
and they'll just fucking churn.
If you put out a trash video
that you think is aesthetically pleasing,
but no one interacts with it, that's your sign.
that, hey, maybe they didn't find it that useful.
Maybe there weren't enough insights in the video
that they can walk away with.
So it's, again, a culmination of all of those things together.
And yeah, finally, this is obviously,
all of us know what good design looks like.
And I'll talk about that briefly.
But yeah, just make it aesthetically pleasing.
Yeah.
Which would you say is the most important,
like, of the usefulness?
Like, which?
Have you seen the slide deck before?
Yeah, we'll get to it, but I'll answer that in just a second.
Yeah, but at any point, feel free to ask me any questions.
These are very abstract concepts, so feel free to ask any questions.
What's a one good example of what you just went through before,
say, picking an out-
You would work with what-
Picking what?
Or like a trail.
Picking- I said, picking an outfit.
Outfit.
If I'm wearing an outfit, how do I design that outfit for myself so that it meets those
criteria for others?
What does that actually look like in practice?
Yeah, so, well, it depends on what the film is about, depends on how the story goes.
Are you talking about films?
I will, I first mentioned outfits, second thing was filming because it seems like I
wasn't communicating.
Also basically, what are you trying to communicate?
What's your story?
How do you want people to perceive you?
How do you want yourself to be perceived by others?
Right?
I wear the same outfit every day,
every single fucking day.
There's many reasons for that,
but again, at the end of the day,
it's like, it's an intentional choice I make, right?
So, and that answer is different for everyone, right?
Where a lot of people are extremely vocal
about how they want their personality
to be projected by the outfits they wear,
and then how you can meticulously iterate and cater that
to the audience and your needs and use feedback, right?
So yeah, finally make it pleasable, enjoy,
and just make sure that in your efforts
to make it aesthetic and beautiful,
do not sacrifice on usability and usefulness.
Make sense?
So, Brayden, what's the most important?
Again, useful.
For most of the work here, it's gotta be useful.
Right, in some cases, those things are figured out for you,
but you can still experiment.
Like Ryan's a good example, right?
He can go out and reinvent apparel from the ground up,
but hey, maybe his version of the T-shirt
is not that applicable to the ones
that we are all familiar with.
So he can iterate on that,
but that's a good starting point.
that hey, just a t-shirt as we know today.
So useful, then make it usable,
and finally focus on making it beautiful.
So this at the bottom is the most important.
Please start there.
Do not start here.
Starting here is no different
than the shit show we see on Dribbble.
Right?
To me that's no different
than just being a snake oil salesman.
Yeah.
If you nail the first two,
do you find that the third one happens on its own kind of?
Or do you have to like put a lot of everything into it?
Really, really good question.
And that's kind of like, you know,
even in the beginning when I started
that I've done this like half a dozen times,
like I kind of want to walk you through a process
so that you can understand.
Because in the pursuit of making it useful and usable,
there'll be so many ideas you already get
on how to make it usable.
Right, and a lot of you like,
I'm sure like some of the musicians here,
as you're kind of like crafting your first beat
and you're adding lyrics to it,
you kind of already are picturing some version
of like the aesthetic music video that's going out.
But do not rob yourself of this process.
All right, quick disclaimer on tools,
cause I see a lot of people in this boat,
people here and just people that have gone
through this presentation a few times.
Do not focus that much on the tool.
They're great, but only if they push you forward.
Oftentimes we spend so much time
just overthinking what tools
and you're rather off just kind of starting.
And it's like recent, it's a similar tweet
that I did, I think this week, I can't even remember where,
just started a similar place
and then you can kind of like figure out
where to go from there.
But do not like wait six days evaluating
the best fucking framework,
should I use Premiere Pro or DaVinci Resolve?
Like stop, right?
Just start somewhere familiar and go,
it's okay if that place is Canva,
it's okay if that place is CapCut, right?
It's completely okay.
So I get that a lot where people are just obsessing about,
hey, Stavon, Framer, huh?
That's the move now.
I go, what do you use right now, right?
Is it going to take you two months to learn Framer
and then two weeks to implement,
like then you're robbing yourself
for essentially 10 weeks worth of time.
Whereas you could have had 10 weeks
worth of feedback in that time.
So does not matter, but again,
as long as you have something to start with,
just go from there.
Yeah, so start with something you're comfortable with,
ideally one that you already know how to use.
For me, a lot of times, that's fucking pen and paper, baby.
Right, I just go directly in pen and paper
and just like start ironing it out.
And it's also really easy when you do this.
Like this example was we were in Mexico City
almost two years ago, well 18 months ago,
and we were figuring out the next chapter
for Buildspace at the time.
And we had like a good brainstorming session
and immediately I like right then and there,
I was like, okay, what do you guys think?
Right, especially if you have like a team
of trusted people around you,
you can just be like, hey, what do you think?
And then take that feedback.
So essentially that was this, I just threw this out for them
and I showed it to them, got some feedback
and then just moved on with it.
Again, all done within a span of 15 minutes
after the conversation happened.
I could have very well gone into Figma,
spent two, three days on it,
but again, I'm robbing myself of that.
And I made that mistake a lot in my teens and early 20s
where I feel like we can be better about this, right?
I just don't want you guys to make that same mistake.
Because I see that, right?
Where so many times you guys are afraid to share with us
because you want us to envision the final product
that you guys are thinking about.
But in the beginning, you kind of like, not just us,
but even like you rob your audience of that experience
because they're following you for the journey,
not the destination.
Right, imagine if I was making a film
and I just showed you the final five minutes of the film
where the hero's off sailing off the sunset.
Like you'll be like, well, what's actually his journey?
What's his ups and downs?
And you guys are all like that hero
and your audience at large is like, again,
subscribing you to that film.
So please, please, please just show them,
like bring them along.
So yeah, when you overcomplicate this,
you create like these unscalable mountains in your head.
So you just have to like, even if you look at the logo
that's on a lot of your guys' chest right now,
like the way that was designed was,
hey, like we just help you scale unscalable mountains.
We just make it so that the steps are there for you
to kind of just go and achieve
whatever it is that you want to achieve.
And yeah, once you have feedback, you can improve it.
So essentially I got this immediately then I was like,
all right, let's not even go to Figma yet.
Excalibur, let's rough it out.
Let's see what it looks like actually, right?
So this tool is called Excalibur.
It's like just this massive canvas
where you can just like start writing on it.
And it feels like really like pen and papery,
but it's still like there's a lot of different blocks
you can use.
And there's some flow charts there
where you can kind of like see like,
okay, user comes to the landing page
to learn how to handle their username,
things of that nature.
And you can go from there.
And once I got feedback on this,
immediately again, this is as soon as we came back,
this is half a day's worth of stuff.
There's a lot more to it, obviously, that I'm not showing,
but then you can kind of like focus.
So this was again, the usefulness aspect, the user bill,
like, you know, how are the interactions going to be?
And then you can kind of like,
the one that we actually shipped out
was this beautiful pages for like the,
all the user profiles, all the company profiles,
things like that.
This idea flopped, don't get me wrong,
it was fucking trash.
But hey, we legit shipped it in a span of two weeks.
We're suspending all this time making it pretty,
creating the perfect flow, like interactions and Figma,
and all, it's like, no, just don't do that.
Not worth it.
We learned a lot by just going through
this exercise a few times.
Who's used this by the way?
Anyone remember?
Rohit, Braden, you created a profile?
Yeah, this is I think pre a lot of your guys' day
at Bill's face but it was fun.
Any questions about this?
All right, just fundamentals in five minutes.
Again, this is gonna be fast
because I think most of you have gone through this.
Please correct me if you guys haven't
and I'll pause and talk about it.
I use a very simple model.
It's my own trademark.
Actually, it's not.
It's not trademarked, but it is my own.
It's called chats.
Who's gone through this?
Show of hands.
Go ahead.
All right, so it's new for a lot of people.
I'll slow down then.
So chats, right?
Basically, the C in chats stands for color and contrast.
Simple, right?
And again, this is like more,
You have a useful and usable design,
let's just make it aesthetic,
just follow this framework to make it that.
Color contrast, what does that mean?
Who likes this?
Why?
Contrast.
It's hard to read, right?
Anyone actually likes it?
We had a couple of students,
I don't know, I fucked with it hard.
I was like, chill.
How about this?
So one thing that I've observed is like with our gen like we're so internet native that
you know like a lot of people ask me Stephen how do you develop the design eye?
But I think so many of us are spending so much time like consuming content like we all have a
pretty good fine tuning on what looks good versus what is right so it's like just be intentional
and anytime you come across like a good piece of content that's like catching it's like stopping
your scroll obviously there's a lot that goes into it but just take like a moment of like
self-reflection as to like what it is about that that actually got you hooked and then continue on
your journey of like doing scrolling but like that moment like do not rob yourself from that
moment of self-reflection all right so in this both the color and contrast is fucked and this
the color is okay, the contrast is what's the main issue. So we can just quickly fix that, right?
Just like upping the contrast. This is a whole lot better than this, right? So it's like, and then you
can like, then you can like really play around with it. You can kind of like increase contrast
and then you have a pretty good palette to like fuck with. Cool. All right. H hierarchy. Super
simple. Read this. Yeah, so it's like if there's no obvious guidance for direction, the viewer is
going to go top to bottom and in most cases left to right. In Arabic countries, it's right to left.
so simple to fix just make it super like it's as if like you're feeding a baby like you know
like mush carrots like all right read this one first and then read the rest and they'll be like
i bet i'm gonna do that make sense super simple all right a is alignment just align your shit
super straightforward uh this is a bad example of it obviously you guys can all look at it as
you know trash bro even though this is meeting all the color all the contrast all the hierarchy
shit's just not aligned so simple align it you can also center like you can like then
with it like a little bit but like once you like again for next time i'm gonna do against chats
with like an asterisk right because like once you understand these principles then you have like full
autonomy to with those right but it's like like if you don't understand those fundamentals then
it's like you're just like you're just like throwing stuff at the wall and seeing what sticks
cool makes sense t is typography uh this is important but not that important but like again
the goal here is to not do stuff like this where you're just using like three different things
Even though everything's aligned, hierarchy's there,
color contrast is there.
It's like, just make intentional choices
about the things you're doing.
In most cases, we use one, at most,
like two different typefaces.
Another bad example.
So yeah, just stick to something that you've, yeah.
What's the Go-Space font?
It's Manrope.
Manrope.
Yeah, but we're changing.
Anyone figured out the new font yet?
Custom font.
It's, I chilled it.
Custom font.
We've dropped it, actually.
Dropped it all in.
So like, me with like, all this is my art, right?
So like, I drop hints everywhere.
They were sprinkled in.
Even before the houses were released, the houses were out in the wild.
it's just like because I'm always looking for that cracked fucking person
right where who's gonna like like decode all of it haven't found him yet or her
yet but they're all the sprinkles are always going to be there in my work and
finally spacing this is both letter spacing and line spacing and I'll talk
about both in this case what do you guys think is wrong with this one in the
middle right so like essentially the line spacing and this is just atrocious so pretty simple to fix
it also like allows you to like break apart different components where you want people
to focus on this but this is just like a tag so again line spacing letter spacing there's fancy
words for it right design school be like leading and kind of like fine just make it simple line
spacing and letter spacing letter spacing is the space between the letters line spacing is
The space between the lights, that's it.
All right, what's wrong with this?
This is almost there, pretty good for the most part.
Right, it's just like give things space to breathe.
This is too much space to breathe.
Right, but again, just like be intentional about it.
And finally, just try to be consistent
because you want people to like associate
whatever your art is to you.
there's so many times I get tagged and our team gets tagged on Twitter with
like random black side slides with like white text in the middle because that's
so iconic to us and we're like bro that's not us I don't but it's like
that's what you're trying to get right it's like that level of consistency
where people see something really immediately ah Bill's face they just
know it and first it'll be like in smaller and smaller circles obviously
like I'm sure even the way the logo was designed even a lot of the merch
that you guys are wearing there'll be people that kind of recognize that immediately just
because they've seen it and that's all done by design so yeah uh so once you have this right
this hits all of the different check boxes then you can like really kind of like go around and
just like play so these would be like the four different colors for example this was season four
where again meeting all the different things but then you can really like have liberty like play
with it. Make sense? This is Rolexes. I just put it in here for reference because now that you
understand chats, right? And I'm just going to quiz a couple. What does H stand for Michael?
Hierarchy. C, color, contrast, and consistency. A, alignment, T, typography, S, space.
Super simple.
This is like literally a semester's worth of shit.
But just, it's easy.
Do not overcomplicate it.
But once you understand that,
you'll start seeing it every time too, right?
And again, that moment of self-reflection
where you go and be like,
ah, okay, they fucked up on the spacing here.
But like, that's kind of like what's building that
and training that I essentially.
Cool?
Another one.
So like, if you saw this one and this one,
be like okay cool it's still Rolex all right so now going back to this question which is
the art of design how does how do you actually kind of like go through this process so to me
I've always struggled with this because I like again just grew up in it right I don't know a
world where that didn't exist but the best way for me to show this is by just going through our system
and then you guys can ask me any questions about it so i'm just yeah the system we talk about like it
works really efficiently for us again we have a very small team that's doing all these things
from the outside really go there's so many people but no it's it's because we have a pretty good
system especially when it comes out to the content uh and visual style that we're putting out
so we'll start off with the video that you guys just saw this week right and for the youtube
audience that's watching uh we'll kind of pin it i think right there where it all started with
that like this this is essentially like how my desk oftentimes looks but more importantly it's
like, hey, just what does it even actually kind of like feel like, right? Like what's the video,
what's the emotions that I'm trying to get out of it? And how do we make it so that
the video at the end like leaves them through this like emotional journey, but like gives them
the fact that, yo, fuck, dude, I want to try this like now, right? And essentially from there,
we kind of like go and build out more of it.
But like that, that paint right there,
and you guys can maybe take some time to,
you can see the entire entirety of it like mapped out.
And that was last Sunday, I believe.
As soon as we had our,
this is like the promo that we're doing.
We did most of it in just one week
where I kind of just started drawing.
I had Josh with me, Alex was there as well.
And be like, okay, this is kind of like the concept
that I'm thinking where we tie back
some people from our community some videos that have already been kind of like shipped by you guys
and kind of kind of show them and walk them through a process like a use case of what
what it would be like to use our product so from there it essentially kind of like goes into
this part where i'm just like mapping out the entire split of like a really rough script if
you like zoom in here like it's still really really rough because i'm still figuring out
out, okay, what elements can I add? What elements do I need to delete? Right? And once I have that,
I just either go to Josh and be like, okay, Josh, this is like, this is where I think it's going.
How does it feel? And from there, you go into even deeper. I don't know if I can zoom in here,
but let me go and show you guys.
so intro vid like again if you if you look here right kind of like start off
with what i think the video needs to have and then essentially then go into hey how's it going
right and this script is not even the final one but it's like it gives you it gives the team a
really, really good feel of how it's going to flow from one thing to the next to the next.
And after that, again, just iron out the entire script.
And then, again, there's a few other technical challenges here where we did not want it to feel
like a profile while it being a profile. And we wanted it to have this new fresh feeling,
like you should not feel like you're using any other existing app.
It should feel different.
It should evoke the emotions that we're seeking even at this stage.
Yeah, that's how it transpired.
Any questions about this?
How did you go from this is the emotion you wanted to reveal,
to people want to show up?
Yeah, so in my head,
that entire journey map is where I map out a lot of those things.
Because for the profile case,
that's actually I had a lot of different versions of it,
which felt a lot like the one that we had,
but we wanted a more artistic take on it.
So that's where I'm just experimenting a lot.
I'm moving elements around.
I am being ruthless with the content I consume.
So I'll have like a lot of different like just hours.
I think we spent eight to 10 hours
just like looking at different commercials,
different elements, different things.
I can actually show you guys one
that we all fucked with a lot,
maybe towards the end if we have time.
But that was Google Super Bowl ad, I think 2010,
where they went through a journey of a person going abroad,
finding love, then moving abroad,
and all through just a search box.
And I think I was like, okay, we gotta go with,
like this is the emotion I'm trying to convey.
Are you going with sound design?
Huh?
Like the sound design,
do you like spend time on that a lot as well?
In the end, in the end.
And I'll talk about that too a little bit.
So yeah, in this case,
like we wanted it to be,
again, going back to your question,
we wanted it to be fresh and new yet familiar.
So a lot of these elements you've seen across even our stuff,
but this is just like that,
like repackage into something that just feels so new.
So something that I know musicians could do is use reference tracks.
And it sounds kind of similar to how you're using your controls.
Is that a common thing?
And how often is it?
I got the first part, bro.
Musicians using reference tracks.
What did you say after?
We're saying that you really were inspired by the Google app.
Yeah.
This is the emotion that I want to track.
I want to focus in the viewer.
And so I guess what I'm wondering is how many references do you use when you are creating them?
I got you.
So in that case, essentially we looked at so many, but we landed on, okay, the Google one was really, really good.
That's the emotion we're trying to go for.
And then that was pretty much it.
And they had one other version of that, which was essentially, and I'll send both of this in the chat after, or if we get to it here too.
But just those two, man.
That's basically it.
Oh, and we had one other reference,
which was essentially kind of like the first,
which was the A24s loading animation.
That was a really good reference point for us as well.
So just mixing and matching a lot of those
and then just going and applying
our own artistic take on it.
When you're like starting to design the thing,
you're looking for like references
and then you're trying to like consume this content,
how do you find things that might be relevant?
Or like, is it kind of just like you're doing scrolling
or are you like intentionally picking things?
Well, so that's like a background process
which has like just developed over years
that I've just taken so many screenshots.
I've consumed so much content intentionally
and I have a pretty decent memory.
And we also have just Apple's ability
to kind of like surface things back up to you
that you can kind of just be like,
oh, that, that, that, that, that.
So for me, that time is still a lot,
but it's not weeks, right?
So for context, there's startups, companies,
and even like the Apple keynote.
Apple keynote is like the top of the line, right?
They spent fucking six months working on that shit.
There's like a team of like 60 people.
We have two weeks.
We've got five homeboys, right?
That's basically it.
So it's like you really have to find ways
to like shortcut a lot of those processes.
For me, like the work I've put in prior
just helps me a lot.
But I know if you're starting from scratch, like, but again, that's where it's like,
like, just, you're already going to be scrolling a little bit, you know,
already consume, just be intentional about it.
And that's like, this was the culmination of all of those things combined.
Right.
So for example, actually let's take a detour lads.
So if you go to, uh, this, this is a new font or one of them, by the way, anyway,
Let's come back to this part.
So who stayed till here?
Fucking hell.
So even this part?
I mean like oh pretty simple right but like this was inspired by old boy
where if you look at
this was the so this so it's like kind of like just having that map in your head
and if you're a visual person that just helps you a lot so if you look at how
it started for example goes into black starts and then essentially pans out right so we took a
version of that but this weird me and jeff have been talking about this for months right like
yo we gotta have a video with the end credits josh has probably heard that like i don't know like
hundreds of times so it's like just finding the best time and just storing them in in your in
in your backlog is what's super important.
Also loading and animation, that's in the finals.
So we have a video now with again,
Mylene's voice and Alex's voice.
It's like, okay, we need to make it feel fresh.
So that's where like, okay, cool.
Let's, what kind of different animation things can we do?
So we wanted like relatively bubbly animation.
Josh's friend helped us out,
but even to get it started, I was like, okay,
I can spend maybe 10 hours in Adobe After Effects
and so can Josh, but is that the best use of the time?
I'm like, no.
What's the tool that's familiar with me
that I'm just like fucking good at?
Framer.
I just started and I created this,
buildspace.so forward slash loading.
I was like, what do you guys think?
Right?
And it's like, okay, we send that to Josh's friend
and we're like, okay, we all fuck,
like take this and start like from here.
And then he used his artistic touch.
But again, I'm not like,
I'm always trying to cut my time the shortest
because I'm not here spending 15 hours
and like, no, that's not the best use of my time.
It's like, what's the thing that I can do like immediately?
This took me two minutes to make.
Right, but now someone has a reference
and now they can take that reference
and use their own creations.
Okay, so that's how the, and for the sound, that's just Farsa using his mouth.
Oh, for tracks and stuff.
Bro, that's, don't tell anyone though.
So, they're laughing at the Farsa mouth sounds.
But, bro, that's, you just gotta feel it, right?
I think when Kieran showed me that track in my head, he asked me a question too.
that's like, oh, I don't even know what question
he asked me to be honest with you guys.
Cause in my head, it's like, this is fucking it
for that for credits, right?
And like, again, we do the same thing with sounds.
When we come across music, we're like, okay,
this would be good for that or that or that.
And then over time, when those opportunities present,
we just kind of like plug and we go in
and we work backwards in many ways from the music.
So yeah, everyone saw the video.
But that's, and then we kind of like,
the finishing touches are okay,
making it feel more alive where we added these little pop-ups
to actually be like, okay, actions are actually happening.
And then the loading animation and Farza's mouth track came in
right then and there, clutch.
So that's kind of like the art of the process.
Does that make sense?
It's like a magician revealing the tricks, and now it doesn't feel, but like it's like
the goal here is any of you can do that.
It's not that complicated.
I love how you trust your ways.
Like, I mean, you were like, I need to animate it, so I'll, I know framer the most, so I'll
just go do what I know the best and then I'll hand it off to someone else.
I would end up searching on YouTube,
Haru, animate on After Effects,
and then I'd spend 24 hours making something
that is not as good at like.
Yeah.
So trusting your ways is just so important.
I have a method of doing things,
and if I trust in them, I could do so much more.
So much more, yeah.
Because we're all limited by time, right?
Like, we just are.
I make a lot of stuff in Google Slides.
I don't use Photoshop.
Brian, you had a question?
Yeah, I might have missed it,
but what was the emotion you wanted to convey
with the last video?
So the last video was essentially like,
it started off with all these people posting their stuff
and not getting like that much,
like not getting found, right?
And our entire thesis with even the product
is to find and be found.
So the goal here is like, hey, even if you have two views
or three views, if those three views are actually
going to move you forward, then this product
is what's going to help you do that.
That's the emotion.
Cool?
Yeah.
I saw a great example of the tools thing.
Madlib is obviously one of the greatest producers of all time.
And I saw a clip of him talking about how,
for the last 10 years since the iPad came out.
The tools he uses is an iPad and GarageBand, and that's it.
And that like blew my mind.
Because you would, yeah, the level of mastery,
it's like you would never tell
that those were the tools he was using.
But it's just because it's easy.
You can do it anywhere.
And it's just fatiguing, right,
just going through all these,
It's like you're not focused on creativity and art
and birthing new things into the world
in terms of like an artist's way.
And you always like,
like you'll always come across these inflection points
where you'll have to,
like for me like Framer is a good example where
before that I used to do everything.
My entire, like all my studios were doing stuff in Webflow.
Before that it was WordPress,
but like Webflow outdated WordPress for me
and using Framer just felt so intuitive
because it combined the best of using Figma
and Webflow into one platform and I can also code in it.
So it's like, fuck, this is perfect.
And I'm like pretty close with the team too,
so I can like kinda like be like,
yo, I'm messing up here and here, can you help me out?
Right, and they'll do a really, really good job
at adding features and things of that nature.
So I just completely shifted.
And once I went in, I'm like, okay, this is it.
This is going to be the tool of choice
to the foreseeable future.
Never having to rethink about that.
Cool.
Yeah, and I'm sure you've seen all of the final result,
but like for you, the key takeaway here is like,
start finding that process for yourself today, ideally.
And all of you guys probably already have
some kind of process, just try to like convert that
into a system you can trust.
And then yeah, just trust this process.
that this process is what's going to take you far.
It's gotta be fast.
And ultimately over time, you'll keep refining
and like kind of like chiseling away at this process.
They'll just help you like become the best version
of the artist that you're trying to be.
And yeah, improve it over time.
All right.
Yeah, finally some mental models.
Yeah, these are just tools.
Don't fall in love with the tool.
Would you fall in love with the fucking pencil?
No, right?
Same thing.
Please know who you're building for.
So this is kind of cool where, what is this app?
Right, everyone knows this is Netflix.
This is again, like for a very straightforward
like and defined set of audience.
And what is this app?
Well, I've written it down, it's IT and China,
but like a North American audience would probably be like,
what the fuck is going on here?
There's live comments, share to earn prices,
a way to screenshot, a way to record GIFs.
You can literally like, you can buy Dolby Atmos for a video,
just for that video for like pennies on the dollar, right?
And, but this is again, in China,
they're really used to microtransactions,
like hyper use, like they don't mind.
Like for example, you can read 70% of a book for free
and then you can pay for every thousand words, pennies.
Like it's like shit, like we would just be able to know
like how many times we just buy books and never read?
So it's like this was their effort
to get more people to read.
But like one, the infrastructure is not there
in the United States with like the large banking systems
to like allow for like transactions under a penny, right?
But that's possible in China.
So it's like, again, know the audience,
who you're catering to.
This is also like why I asked you
the audience question yesterday, right?
Is my audience Indians?
Is my audience Indian Americans?
Is my audience third culture kids?
Like who is my audience and who am I writing to?
And over time you can define that further and further.
And that's across the board, right?
Like I used to have this one creator I was incubating
where she, one day she would sell Pantene ads,
the next day she was doing head-in.
I'm like dude, what are you doing?
You're losing, your audience is losing trust in you
because every day you're pushing a new product.
Right, so it's like just be consistent
about what it is that you're trying to do
and know your audience
they can also like sift through the bullshit pretty easily and the easiest way to do that is
just being authentic yeah and don't aim for perfection aim for iteration uh this is from
i think it was at stanford i'm not sure i don't recall but in some college class a university
but it was a photography class they he essentially segmented off his entire class into two audiences
one, all they had to do was take one incredible photo
for the entire semester and they would get an A.
And the other is like, over the next 100 days,
they have to take 100 photos.
And if they did that, no matter if they were trash,
they would get an A.
Which group do you think produced far better pictures?
Maybe 100.
Right.
They just got better at it.
They just got better at it,
because just putting in the reps.
So another one, yeah, don't aim for perfection.
Now let's aim for iteration.
I also have two kind of like sneak peeks
at new mental models that I'm working on,
but let's review our shit.
This is, whose is this?
Where is this guy?
Oh, right here.
All right, real talk.
I didn't read a fucking word.
But, but, keep going.
I bookmarked it lads, right?
I bookmarked it, I was like,
yo, there's some knowledge in here, I will get,
and that's what he was going for, I think.
And again, like this post is incredible,
but again, I think you said that
you didn't spend much time on it.
I wrote it like a month ago,
and then like, I just kept procrastinating,
tried to edit it and perfect it,
because clearly it's very long,
so I kept trying to cut it down,
and then I would just post it,
and then I just posted it.
Beautiful, yeah.
So again,
which will take me to one of my mental models later on,
but love it, dude.
I bookmarked it.
I did.
Yeah, and with posts like that,
you know, even being intentional,
and me and Jeff used to game this a lot back in the day.
We don't do social stuff anymore or that much,
but we're like, okay, this one, it's for bookmarking.
It would get like 20, 30 likes,
but then you would have like hundreds of bookmarks.
It's like all by design.
So this post, when I look at it,
it's designed to be bookmarked,
whether intentional or not, but it did its job.
So yeah, the primary action that you want a user to take
when they come across this post,
they're gonna book, because there's free value,
free information, let me just save it.
And did really, really well, dude, good shit.
All right, who is this?
Everyone saw his new landing page, any thoughts on it?
Any suggestions for our friend?
It feels unbalanced.
Sorry?
It feels like unbalanced to me,
that I wouldn't use to see, for example,
the deep pre-order button in the middle, like.
like 95% of my things that are like,
on the last escape, because the text is left online, so yeah.
No, I'm not.
So now even just learning the stuff
that you learned with chats,
you can make this so much better, right?
But the other thing, I think this is still a lot better
than the one you showed me, right?
Where this one's like, okay, cool,
I think it's a physical device that I just tap, right?
Because not everyone's going to watch this video.
No one's got time for it.
because they're transacting with you at this stage in time and then money right
you're asking them to give 15 30 seconds of their life from what in return right
so it's like just being explicit about this will take you a lot farther I also
went ahead and just did this for you where it's like you can just like
simplify it a lot it's the same shit that you've done right that's it but it's
Just like making, like give an audience a way to like just attach themselves to a few things and then be like, okay, cool.
There's a hundred units.
It's shipping in March and I can block anything with a tap.
And it's an NFC device.
And then just describing it.
It's an NFC device.
I did it in two minutes, so excuse my typo there, but it's an NFC device that lets you block any distractions.
What I showed you, it had like designed against addiction, which doesn't mean anything.
And you're like, what is that?
Cool.
Good stuff, though.
Appreciate you just going out and shipping it, though.
All right.
Who's this?
Oh, that's me.
Want to talk about it?
You shipped this, right?
Yeah, yeah.
This is my podcast.
And basically, I just interview people that are building stuff with no code.
The main chunk of the podcast in the middle is just like a demo.
So we're sort of building some product or side project together.
and I just ask a lot of questions.
I fucking loved this dude.
I really did.
I saved it to a playlist,
and it's an extremely high value video
for people that are just trying to ship a no-code app.
So how can, another one that I saved to watch later.
But how can we blow this to 10x views?
Any feedback?
The starting picture, like it's not.
Maybe you start with a thumbnail, right?
Yeah, that's what I was looking for.
The thumbnail, yeah.
What do you mean?
The title?
Like the thing that captures the audience's attention, like that doesn't particularly-
So change out of thumbnail.
Yeah.
Yeah.

That is like-
Yeah.
And this is really high intent because it's like, people are searching for bubble apps,
right? So again, that's your audience. Okay, just got to funnel them in.
So they're going to mostly come through from YouTube search.
What's the first thing they're going to see? Your title.
description and the thumbnail. Cool. And just another easy one is cross-posting.
Just there's so many different ways and I don't see a lot of you guys doing this, hence
any hacker news, but hence...
Okay, I'm jumping ahead a little bit because I want to talk about my mental mod, it's great.
all right so yeah we can use it in cross post on bubble low code no code all these different places
where you've already done the work bro right you've already made the video posted it on youtube
you'll fix the thumbnail adjust the title you can a b test there as well so now it's like okay let's
just get let's get as many different like you have built this house let's create more doors for people
to come in right one door is youtube search can reddit be another and it's fine if only one person
or no one walks through the door, it's okay.
Right, it's just the amount of time and effort
it took for you to make that video
versus the amount of time and effort it'll take
for you to make that one door, it's like, it's nothing.
Right, so why not do that?
Hacker News is another place.
The worst case in this is like no one walks in
through that door, which would be the same
as if you never posted, but now you're at least
giving it a shot for anyone to walk in through the door.
And what's the best case, dude?
just asymmetrical upside.
The internet's just a crazy fucking place, right?
Where one tweet of yours can blow up
and you have all of a sudden a thousand people
coming and checking out that video.
It's like, don't rob yourself of that.
You can also like cut up the best parts,
work with someone like him.
And just be like, all right, let's just ship them out.
Again, more doors with even like hiring.
I can't tell you guys how many times I've seen
like a podcast clip or a product clip
on TikTok in short form, and then went to YouTube.
Like again, exited the app, went onto YouTube,
searched for the podcast, and then watched it.
Right, so it's like, again,
don't rob yourself of those experiences.
Okay, perfect.
So why are you doing it?
Shit, bro, leave the lecture, who cares?
All right, and now, beautiful.
So this, again, finally, fuck.
All right, the variable lottery tickets mental model.
The first time I'm presenting this,
because it's super important for you guys
to kind of understand this.
So imagine a one billion Powerball, right?
Pretty big Powerball.
And you have two options.
Option one is you buy one ticket for $2.
This is a standard price for a Powerball ticket.
Or I can get you eight tickets for $5.
What do you pick?
Everyone here?
But even though you're spending three extra dollars,
Yeah, I can get that open.
Right?
Makes sense?
Anyone here gonna go with this one instead?
All right.
All right, so most of, in many ways, the internet is just this giant fucking problem, right?
That's all it is.
So you posting on the internet, it's like buying a lottery ticket.
So, right?
So, for example, you post it on YouTube.
You could stop there, right?
But three extra dollars, you cross posting on Hacker News, Reddit,
you can get 10 more tickets for very little effort.
So, place your bets accordingly.
I have a little disclaimer.
We do not endorse gambling or betting.
Please gamble with what you can offer.
But again, it's like barely anything, any effort for you to like just do,
if you're posting on SoundCloud, also post on your Instagram story.
Also make a reel on it.
Also post on TikTok.
Just get your bets in order.
I mean, I imagine that framing also applies to whatever product you're distributing.
Making the audience feel as though they're missing out if they don't get the best off.
Yeah, so that's kind of like the scarcity model, right?
Right? I think you did that this week as well,
where you had 10, 12 spots or 10 spots, 12 spots.
And you're like, okay, only 11 out of 12 gone, right?
So it's like, okay, only one spot left.
I'll just pull the trigger.
Who else did that?
Someone else did that too.
I'm blanking.
Anyway, but yeah, as you start,
I want you to keep one final mental model in mind.
This is a crazy one too. This is a wild one. Is Baby Bolt mental model?
The name may change, still a work in progress, but is a baby fucking Usain Bolt? Yes or no?
Who know who doesn't know Usain Bolt? Everyone knows Usain Bolt?
All right
So most of you are like a baby, right? You're learning how to take your first step
you've mastered the art of crawling but you look around and you see all these other people walking
and you're like man you think to yourself shit I could do that too right you get up you take your
first steps you try but you fall and you're gonna keep falling but you don't go at this time and
and think
man everyone around me walk in and running and like no right like you don't think like that
imagine if you thought like that if you were a baby if a baby had context on usain bolt
and he just taken the first few steps falling look at that guy bro just like running at 9.8
what the how am i ever gonna get there
You see how crazy that sounds, but you see how all of you guys do that.
So you got to not care what others think. It's okay if they laugh at you if you fall,
it's fine. Not a big deal. You got to just get back up, take more steps, lean on others that
can help you and use the support and you can string that first few steps together. And all
of you guys here are going like are there to support each other we're here for you to get and
string those first few steps together and in an alternate universe I believe that if a baby had
full context and understanding uh on a bolt on a person like an Usain Bolt like they would take
10 times longer to just get their first step uh and in many ways that is you guys so uh you guys
have full context on what it takes to be great all the good and bad that comes with it you have
full context on your idols you want to be like jobs gate swift drake whatever the fuck right
uh and you want to achieve the great heights or records that they have set but
just try not to think about that because that will just prohibit you from you and stringing
those first few steps together it'll paralyze you for now just go and take your first few steps
Stop overthinking for baby is not bold.
All right, finally, assist of the week.
Thank you, Kat, so much.
Appreciate you.
And thank you, Kiran and Somaya for the bang.
Cool, that's all.
Thank you, any questions?
Looking back at the video,
what do you think like did not go too right?
Ah, good question, dude.
I think the video in itself,
everything was as expected for the most part.
And we like obsess over the chat too.
And how people, like there's an audible gasp
that you can hear when the first time
all the people popped up, people stopped typing.
And then it's like, oh, that's, so it's like,
all like we couldn't have anticipated a better response
from the video, but it's like, we're back in the lab again.
Just kind of like do the next ones and things of that nature.
But yeah, not much, like, yeah.
Because there's so many constraints that were placed, right?
Like time as a constraint, resources as a constraint,
so many other things to do as a constraint, right?
So it's like, it's fine.
We walk three steps, we didn't fall, great.
We continue walking.
How do you balance consistency in design
with kind of like iterating and combining
what your design is.
Yeah, so that's why I've put consistency at the last,
purely because you'll go through so many iterations
till you find something that works for you
and then figure out ways to be consistent.
So in the beginning, it's very exploratory for sure, yes.
I just wanna expand on that or ask that,
that kinda goes into every element
of developing a personal way in terms of like,
maybe a landing page or like what type of product you like to produce.
You're experimenting until you're like, oh, okay, I'm trying to get the hang of this.
This is me.
And then you go to optimize for production.
Yes.
Okay, cool.
I was actually curious.
So I know you spoke about the process a lot.
So I was curious, like, how do you, like, audit that process?
You know, how do you, like, figure out, like, okay, this may be where problems are there,
you know?
Yeah.
Yeah, so basically I like it's for me it's very subconsciously I'll do that but
like now having even gone through the last week or 10 days working on this,
the next time you make like I know I'm going to optimize the process. Like
there's lots of like little tweaks that I can make. So for example like just
making sure the script is actually done one step prior.
Yeah, I think I'm more curious about when you first approach something that's new,
you know when you like you have some sort of process let's say for content
creation but let's say for me I'm going from now I've been writing on Twitter
for a while and I want to start making more like short form video content
right so I have a process for content creation but that process isn't going to
be great for Instagram same as what I use for Twitter right so how do I like
maybe make that shift you know how do I know what's important in the process
that can carry over and solve what doesn't?
So, again, the first few times you just create
three shorts, right?
And just figure, just how you would do it normally.
Right, so maybe ask each or someone
who's already done that.
That's kind of like the benefit you have
because some people here already are making
short form content, but it's like, okay, cool.
Even if you didn't have that, for example.
Like, okay, use a tool that you're familiar with.
Maybe you've used CapCut in it before.
Maybe when you were 70, you fucking turned up iMovie, right?
So like just use whatever you have and then just post it.
And then again, you can still work on the narrative,
you can still work on the script.
And then you can like, again, look at the feedback, right?
Which is like, hey.
What I'm hearing is like,
just you audit the process by doing it.
Well, the first thing you'll learn is like,
how long did it fucking take for me to make three videos,
right?
If it's taking you three days to make it,
be like, okay, can I get it to under a day?
What do I need to introduce in my workflow?
that I can get it under a day, things like that.
And then over time, you can keep refining that for sure.
Yeah, the question about branding.
So I'm considering maybe renaming the product that I have,
just because there was like a, in the same space,
thing with the same name.
And I'm sort of stuck between going for something completely
imaginative, for example, or more descriptive.
like this, for example, domain, .
I don't know whether you have any thoughts about what.
How long have you spent on it?
Not really.
Just pick one and go for it.
Yeah, just pick any, whatever it feels.
Think about it.
The best thing I do is I'll take a problem to bed, right?
And I'll just wake up and I'll have clarity on it.
So pick a few names that you kind of like fuck with,
and the domains are available, the handles are available,
and then just go.
You can always rename.
Facebook became meta after God knows how long, right?
So it's like, doesn't matter.
All right, thank you so much.
Was this fun?
