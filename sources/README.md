# Sources

The skills in this repo were built from 24 buildspace lectures. This directory contains the raw and processed source material.

## transcripts/

Raw speech-to-text transcripts generated from YouTube audio using [mlx-whisper](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-examples/tree/main/whisper) (whisper-large-v3-turbo on Apple Silicon). Unedited output — useful as a reference but rough to read.

## knowledge/

Cleaned, structured versions of each transcript — key ideas extracted, organized by theme, with quotes preserved. These are what each skill's `references.md` was distilled from.
