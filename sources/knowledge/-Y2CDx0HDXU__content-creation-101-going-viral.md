# Content Creation 101: The Art of Short-Form Content

The speaker is a short-form content creator originally from Greece who has accumulated over 4 billion views across TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram through satirical character-based videos. He performs several characters — a pretentious Greek character, a rich French European kid (1.5 million YouTube followers, over 600K on Instagram), and a newer tech CEO character called "My Tech CEO" (approaching 100K on Instagram at the time of the talk). His formula is deceptively simple: create a satirical, engaging character plucked from real life, place them in different scenarios, and film everything in a realistic style. That combination alone has produced some of the most viral content on the internet.

## The Power of One Video

One of the most striking illustrations of content's reach: the speaker improvised a line in a video where his French character claimed to be from "the richest family in Europe." He didn't think much of it. But major French news outlets — including Le Monde, which he compares to the New York Times of France — picked up the video and started investigating whether this was a previously unknown son of Bernard Arnault. Half of France was questioning whether the billionaire had a sixth child, all from a single improvised video recorded on a phone. The Daily Mail and the New York Post also ran stories. The point isn't self-congratulation — it's that a single phone video with the right concept can reach and move entire populations. "I'm blown away by the fact that one video that I record on my phone with the right concept was able to get posted on Le Monde, was able to get half of France questioning if there was another son of this billionaire."

This wasn't always the case for him. His early videos got around 600 views. The difference between then and now came down to understanding and applying specific principles.

## The Four Keys to Viral Content

### 1. Hook the Viewer

Every second matters, especially the first few. The hook gives context to a new viewer who has landed on your content and is immediately asking: what am I watching, and why should I care? The hook is the single most important element because when you're starting out and building a brand, nobody knows who you are. People don't need a good reason to listen to you — they need a reason not to scroll away. The hook itself has to do that work without you having to establish credibility first.

A strong hook can be visual (an unusual setting, someone crying), verbal (a surprising or absurd statement), or contextual (text overlay that reframes what you're seeing). The key is that it immediately creates a reason to keep watching.

**Example — the European kid video**: It opens on a realistic-looking scene in Greece. Immediately you get context — it looks like someone filming their annoying brother arguing with their dad about money. The setting itself is a hook. Then the character starts crying about needing 1,000 euros for pizza and demanding a physical card. It's so ridiculous that you can't look away. That video got 30 million views.

**Example — the DJ video (33 million views)**: A girl is crying while asking "What do DJs actually do?" The crying is the visual hook — you're immediately wondering what's going on. The question itself is the verbal hook — it's something most people have genuinely wondered about. Even though the video is "stupid," it follows every principle.

**Example — the spyware resume video**: Starts with standard career advice framing ("stop adding text at the bottom of your resume"), then pivots to "instead, embed spyware onto it so when the recruiter opens it, their computer gets infected." The hook works because you're expecting conventional advice and get something completely unexpected. You immediately want to know what else this person is going to say.

### 2. Evoke Emotion

The video needs to make the viewer feel something. What's interesting is that it doesn't have to be a positive emotion. The French European kid character actually makes people angry — who is this rich, pretentious kid? — but anger drives engagement just as effectively as laughter. TikTok's algorithm doesn't distinguish between positive and negative emotional engagement; it registers that people are reacting, and it promotes the content.

The speaker has since pivoted toward his tech CEO character, which elicits more positive emotions, but the principle holds: the emotion can go either way. Accounts covering disturbing topics like human trafficking don't create happy feelings, but they hold attention because the emotional response — concern, outrage, curiosity — is powerful. The question isn't "does this make people happy?" but "does this make people feel something?"

### 3. Create Questions

You want viewers asking questions as they watch. Don't feed everything to the audience. You want them wondering: what's going to happen next? Who is this person? Why is this happening? The viewer should have a sense of direction — maybe they can anticipate where the video is going — but there should always be gaps that their mind is actively trying to fill. This cognitive engagement is what keeps people watching through the entire video.

### 4. Don't Give the Audience What They Want

This is the most counterintuitive principle. Think about the viral videos you've watched four or five times. You didn't get what you wanted out of them — they triggered something that made you want to watch again. Maybe you're trying to digest what just happened, or you noticed something you missed. The goal is to leave the viewer slightly unsatisfied, not in a frustrating way, but in a way that creates a pull to rewatch. "You actually want to not give your audience enough for them to be satisfied, so they watch your video again. They're trying to digest what just happened."

The European kid video demonstrates this perfectly: you walk away thinking "who the heck is this? I have so many questions. I need to watch this again to understand what happened." None of your questions are fully answered, but there's enough context that you're compelled to try again.

## The Balance Between Context and Mystery

There's a fine balance between giving people enough context and leaving enough open questions. These two forces are in tension. If you overdo context, people know exactly what they're going to get and have no reason to stay curious. If you underdo it, people are confused and scroll away.

This came up repeatedly in the live video critiques. A chess-themed video had an interesting visual — chess content is unusual on most feeds — but lacked enough context for the viewer to understand what was happening or why they should care. The fix isn't to explain everything but to give a framing: "this chess player beats his opponent in five moves" — now you know what you're watching and you're curious to see those five moves play out. A robot soccer video had the same issue: cool visuals, no framing. Something as simple as "it's raining outside, so I built a robot to play football inside" turns disconnected shots into a story with a concept.

The principle: give just enough context that the viewer understands what's happening and can form expectations, but leave enough open that they're compelled to keep watching or rewatch.

## Live Critique Lessons

The speaker reviewed several audience videos, and the feedback patterns reinforce the core principles:

**Too long, too many concepts.** Multiple videos tried to cover several ideas in one piece. The advice was consistent: narrow it down. One concept per video. If you have three ideas, make three videos. A video about meeting co-founders, building a startup, and missing school is three separate pieces of content. When you cram too much in, the viewer can't remember what you said.

**The first frame sets expectations.** If your video starts with a seagull and then shifts to motivational speaking, the audience assumes the video is about the seagull and leaves before the interesting part. Whatever your strongest content is, lead with it. Don't bury it after an unrelated opening. "When you start a video, you want to give your audience a suggestion of what's about to happen."

**Corporate-looking content repels.** One team made a polished sit-down video introducing their startup. The speaker's reaction: it felt like a corporate video. This is important because first-time content creators naturally gravitate toward what they've seen before — professional-looking, produced content. The advice channels Tim Ferriss: do the opposite. People are used to those polished videos, and they scroll past them. Do something people aren't used to seeing.

**Emotion can carry a video.** A personal storytelling video about living a double life between home and university had 68K views. It wasn't hyper-engaging in the hook-every-second sense — it was investing the audience in a personal story. The speaker acknowledged this is a different approach from his own style but equally valid: "Sometimes this slower-paced content does better because people are less used to it."

**Jump to the interesting part faster.** A music video opened with the creator talking, then panned to a more compelling second scene with an original song. The advice: jump to the song faster. If the interesting part is the second half, restructure so it comes first. You won't get a second chance if the audience drops off during a slow opening.

## The Democratization of Views

We're at an inflection point in social media. Platforms like TikTok and Instagram have fundamentally changed the distribution model. Three or four years ago, you needed an established following to get meaningful reach. Now, anyone with a phone can create a viral video if the content is right. The algorithms have said: "If you don't have followers, you can still create viral content. You just have to create something that the algorithms are going to like."

This is what makes the current moment so significant for builders. Your phone is a tool that can reach millions of people. That reach can be used to inspire, to change narratives, to build audiences, to drive attention to what you're building.

## Experimentation Is the Only Way to Learn

You cannot think your way to a viral video. You have to experiment and get real-time feedback. The speaker is emphatic about this: "You're not a pro in understanding what's gonna go viral unless you're experimenting and getting real-time feedback." The learning comes from posting, seeing what doesn't work, understanding why — the title was too long, the audio wasn't good enough, the hook was weak — and building foundational knowledge through iteration.

Once you find something that works, double down. When the European kid character went viral, the speaker kept making videos with that character. Then he took the same underlying style — satirical character, realistic filming, engaging scenarios — and applied it to a new tech CEO character. Different character, same proven formula. The tech account grew to nearly 100K Instagram followers in a few months.

## Find Your Unique Genius

Everyone brings something different. The speaker's talent is improvisation and accents — he can switch from his normal voice to a rich French European kid in a heartbeat. That's not a copyable skill, and that's the point. MrBeast's genius is an obsession with studying the algorithm and creating mass-appeal video concepts. Your genius is something else entirely.

"You can't copy people. Yes, you can copy people and get some success, but then at the end of the day if you're copying someone else's talent and you don't have that talent, it's not gonna work for you." The European kid character wasn't derived from watching someone else do accents. It came from the speaker experimenting, recognizing that filming cars and scenery wasn't leveraging his strengths, and pivoting to put himself in front of the camera where his improvisational skills could shine.

The process: experiment broadly, notice what leverages your specific strengths, and then lean into that. Your content style should emerge from the intersection of what you're uniquely good at and what audiences respond to.

## Content Strategy for B2B and Product-Based Companies

A detailed exchange with an audience member building a B2B analytics tool surfaced a critical insight: your product is boring, and that's fine. Don't try to make the product itself go viral. Instead, figure out what content your target demographic actually wants to consume, create that, and then find ways to introduce your product once you have their attention.

The speaker's tech CEO character is a deliberate example of this. It wasn't an accident that the account attracts tech founders with money — that's exactly the demographic he wanted to reach. "I didn't by accident reach tech founders with money. It was because I wanted to do that. I wanted to network with more of these guys." If he wanted to launch a B2B product, he'd use the existing audience: create funny videos around the launch, DM founders who engage with his content. That's a fundamentally different go-to-market channel than cold email or paid ads, and it's entirely organic.

The B2B content strategy: build an audience of your target customers by creating content they enjoy (not about your product), then leverage that audience and the relationships it creates. "Don't focus on your product, especially if you're B2B SaaS. Focus on the attention, and then you can find ways to actually sell the product." You can pin a product video to your profile, link to your website in your bio, DM engaged followers — there are many ways to monetize attention once you have it.

Buildspace's own content was cited as an example of this done well: their videos showcase someone facing a challenge, which naturally makes people want to root for them and follow along. The narrative structure — person with a goal, obstacles in the way, will they succeed? — is inherently engaging.

## Short-Form vs. Long-Form

The speaker's advice for someone making educational YouTube content (long-form): start with short-form to master the art of attention, then apply those skills to long-form. Short-form is about hyper-engaging, shareable moments. Long-form is about having something genuinely compelling to share — if you don't have interesting substance, no amount of production will save you. "If you have long-form content but you don't really have something interesting to share, then why the hell should I listen to you?"

The ideal path: learn attention mechanics through short-form, then take those instincts into long-form where the substance carries the video. Or, if you already have compelling long-form material, challenge yourself to extract short-form clips from it.

## On Clickbait

Clickbait works short-term but damages your brand long-term. "You're building a brand. You can do clickbait, it works short-term, but long-term people are gonna watch your videos and they're gonna be like, this is the guy I want to avoid watching." On YouTube specifically, the incentive structure is different because watch time matters so much that creators are more desperate to get you to click — but from a brand-building perspective, the principle holds: don't promise what you don't deliver.

## AI and the Future of Content

Faceless accounts — no person on camera, no real voice — are already getting significant views using tools like ElevenLabs for voice cloning, AI-generated visuals, and stock footage. This trend will only accelerate.

But the speaker pushes back hard on the conclusion that AI will replace human content creators. AI will enhance creators, not replace them. "Think about what I could do if I had a Steve Jobs clone right here as a result of AI. Think about the content that I could create." He already uses ChatGPT for scripts and video concepts. The future isn't AI making content instead of you — it's AI supercharging what you can produce, enabling styles of video that weren't possible before: AI-generated b-roll, celebrity voice clones for sketch comedy, fully generated visual narratives layered over real performances.

The takeaway: experiment with AI tools as part of your content creation workflow. You might discover an entirely new style of content that's only possible because of a specific tool. The creators who integrate AI into their process will have an enormous advantage over those who don't.

## Any Context Can Become a Video

In a live brainstorming exercise, the audience generated multiple viral video concepts from nothing more than the fact that they were in a room with someone on stage: "this guy thinks he's Steve Jobs" filmed from the audience, a personality-switching sketch, a meta video about creating viral content during a lecture about viral content. The point: you can take any context — any setting, any situation — and turn it into engaging content if you apply the principles. "You can literally take any idea, any context, even just the stage and the fact that you guys are here, and turn it into an interesting, engaging video."
