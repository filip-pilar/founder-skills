# How to Write Better

Writing is not just words on a page. It's the most powerful way to shape the world. At its core, writing is how you invite people into your mind, your stories, and your view of the world. Buildspace itself was built on exactly this — words in emails, words in tweets, words in videos. Everything starts with writing.

And writing is holistic. You should never separate visuals from writing — they're part of a greater whole. The book *I'm Glad My Mom Died* by Jennette McCurdy illustrates this perfectly: the title alone reads as dark or psychopathic, but paired with a bright, comedic cover design, it becomes funny. The same words carry entirely different meaning depending on their visual context. This principle applies to everything you write — emails, tweets, landing pages, video scripts. The words and the visual presentation are inseparable.

## The Framework: Clear, Meaningful, Persuasive

Good writing has the same structure as good design (which Stavon defined as usable, useful, and beautiful). Good writing needs to be **clear**, **meaningful**, and **persuasive**. These three qualities build on each other in order — and the first two do most of the heavy lifting.

## Clear and Understandable

If people don't understand what you're trying to say, they won't even care. The worst-case scenario isn't rejection — it's that people can't say yes *and* can't say no, so they just scroll past. They don't even read it.

A cold email to Shaan Puri demonstrates clarity done right. The applicant wrote: "Hey Shaan, I made an irreversible decision. Just 30 days in, I quit [job]. The opportunity cost of not being full-time in crypto was too high. Lucky for you, this means I'm on the market. I think you should hire me." He even bolded the key lines so Shaan didn't have to read the rest. The intent was instantly clear: I quit my job, I think you should hire me, I want to run NFT experiments for Milk Road.

### Write with an Eraser

The most reliable way to achieve clarity is subtraction. Charlie Munger's principle of inversion applies directly: instead of thinking about everything you need to add to make writing good, figure out what to remove. If you want to write more effectively, stop doing the things that make your writing worse.

This was demonstrated live with a video producer's job application to Buildspace. The original was a wall of text that felt like ChatGPT output — trying to be casual and formal simultaneously, no links to actual work, no easy way for the reader to make a decision. The room's instinct was to delete the entire first paragraph. The consensus: the first paragraph tried to establish legitimacy but could have been one line ("I have experience at multiple companies, here's my portfolio"). The tone was off — it read like the applicant was doing Buildspace a favor rather than applying. And critically, for a video producer, there was no video.

The rewritten version opened with: "Damn, I really like the content Buildspace is putting out there. It's really a fresh take on what education is." This establishes context and genuine familiarity. Then: "To be honest, I'm inspired to ditch everything I got going on in the past to work with y'all. My work with startups, traditional broadcast TV, media for ads, live stream, etc. None of that matters." The trick here is listing credentials and then immediately dismissing them — it signals both experience and willingness to learn something new. It ends with: "Check out three things I made in the past I'm proud of and I think you'll like. Hit me up for a chat." Plus a specific observation: "Your YouTube sucks, so I'm going to help you with your YouTube." Three links. Easy yes or no.

### The Hemingway Standard

The Hemingway App (hemingwayapp.com) is a practical tool for measuring readability. The Buildspace email about their show for 32 builders scored at a grade 1 reading level. Unless you're writing research papers for PhD holders, aim low on readability scores. If your audience needs a PhD to parse your writing, you've failed — unless your audience literally has PhDs and expects technical density.

### Sticker Mule as a Case Study in Clarity

Sticker Mule's emails are a masterclass: "Hello. Tape is half off today. Get 100 feet of custom tape for only $9. Normally $19, free shipping. —Anthony, co-founder of Sticker Mule. PS, new stuff tomorrow." That's the entire email. Anthony could have written 1,000 words. Instead he wrote something that hits hard precisely because it respects the reader's time. "I don't really need tape, but it's half off, so I'm listening."

## Meaningful

This is where storytelling enters the picture. Everyone has heard "know your audience" until it's meaningless advice. Here's a sharper framing: **write for people who are meaningful to you.** Not write *to* people — write *for* people. The distinction matters. When you do something *for* someone, the care shows up in the work.

*Everything Everywhere All at Once* is an example of a film so obviously crafted for a specific audience that you can feel it. When creators write for people they genuinely care about, the work becomes meaningful even when it's as simple as "Hello, tape is half off today."

### The Progression: Self → Past Self → Specific Person

The first person you should write for is yourself. If you wouldn't stop scrolling for your own content, if you wouldn't read your own email, it's probably not meaningful to anyone else. It's obvious on TikTok and Instagram when someone is chasing impressions with formulaic hooks versus creating something they actually care about.

After yourself, write for your past self. Jeff describes writing Buildspace content by imagining himself two or three years ago — a version of himself who would have been excited by nights and weekends, who would have wanted to join. After that, imagine a specific real person you've encountered, sitting across from you, and write to convince that one person.

### Taylor Swift and "All Too Well"

In 2012, Taylor Swift was 23 and wrote "All Too Well" for her album *Red*. It was her favorite song, but she thought it was too personal — meaningful to her but not something people would care about. She included it anyway. It became one of her biggest anthems. Fans obsessively request it at concerts, exchange friendship bracelets with its lyrics, and turned it into a cultural phenomenon.

The original was five minutes long. She wanted it to be ten minutes but held back, thinking nobody would listen to a ten-minute song. When she re-released the album as *Taylor's Version* in 2021 (re-recording to own her masters after the originals were controlled by the studio), she expanded it to the full ten minutes. It became a short film starring Sadie Sink. Still one of her most beloved works.

The lesson: the thing you think is too personal, too niche, too much *you* — that's often exactly what resonates. Stay authentic. It will pay off.

### Keep Shooting and Figure Out Your Target

You need to keep posting because it's the only way to get feedback on whether you're finding the right target — or even if that's the target you want. Think of it as a process. Write regularly, not just for your product but for yourself. The Buildspace team spends time writing about all sorts of things to wrap their heads around what they're building.

The forcing function that works well: anytime you're coming up with something new, immediately think about how you'll communicate it to the audience. The Buildspace team went through six to ten versions of the same message announcing their new direction — "We shut down our company for a month," "I became a monk for a month" — each iteration refining the intent. The intent was threefold: tell people they're doing something different, reaffirm the same mission (build a world where anyone with an idea can turn it into reality), and address different audience segments with their specific questions.

This extends to emotional mapping. For the 2424 livestream, Jeff and Josh mapped out the audience's emotional journey across the full hour — when they'd be happy, when they'd dip (learning S5 was delayed), and how to bring them back up. Working backwards from intent is the most important starting point for any piece of writing, but figuring out intent is actually very difficult.

### Kendrick Lamar's Note as Creative Inspiration

Kendrick Lamar published a personal note: "I spent most of my days with fleeting thoughts, writing, listening, and collecting old beach cruisers. The morning rides keep me on a hill of silence. I go months without a phone." The line "I go months without a phone" hits hard because it speaks to something many people feel but don't articulate. This became direct inspiration for Buildspace's own communication approach — studying how an artist communicates "what's next" and applying that to how a company communicates its own transitions.

## Persuasive

If you can nail clear and meaningful, you're already 95% of the way to persuasive writing. The most important element of persuasion is not a trick or technique — it's **consistently doing the first two things**. Show up, communicate clearly, and offer value. That's the most authentic form of persuasion because you're unlikely to nail it on the first launch. It takes repetition.

Naveed from Unriddle exemplifies this. His emails aren't flashy: "Unriddle now finds citations for you. Visualize connections between items in your library. Now available in 30+ languages." He shows up every single day, improving the product and telling people about it. No hard sell. Just consistent value. "He's not trying to sell anything. He's just trying to provide you value." The hook isn't amazing, but the value proposition is so strong it doesn't need to be.

### Building Momentum

The remaining 5% of persuasiveness comes from rhythm and momentum in your writing. Short sentences create forward motion that pulls the reader through.

Pat from Starter Story demonstrates this: "Hey there, Pat here. Happy Wednesday. I have a confession. Starter Story would have failed miserably without the help of one place — the r/entrepreneur subreddit. I was able to hack the subreddit and get millions of free users for zero dollars. Even crazier, I did this when I was a nobody." The sentences are so short you can't help but keep reading. Boom, boom, boom, boom.

Tyler, the Creator's song "I'm Sorry" shows the same principle in lyric form: "I'm sorry, I'm sorry I don't see you more. I'm sorry that four minutes where you see your son could feel like a chore. Sis, I'm sorry I'm your kin. Sorry we ain't close as we should have been. Sorry to my old friends." Once you get into the rhythm, it's fast — it just builds upon itself.

A classic Chivas Regal Father's Day ad uses the word "because" as a rhythmic engine: "Because I have known you all my life, because a red Rudge bicycle once made me the happiest boy on the street, because you let me play cricket on the line, because you used to dance in the kitchen with a tea towel around your waist..." It builds and builds — "because, because, because" — until you're holding a bottle in your hand, one for your dad and one for yourself.

The practical rule: keep sentences short and avoid jargon. This applies equally to video — have the person say one short sentence while the video communicates the rest.

## Working Backwards from Intent

Before any writing begins, you need to answer: what do I want to say to people? This sounds obvious but is actually the hardest part. Many writers struggle not with craft but with clarity of intent.

Jeff's process for Buildspace's software pivot: he started by asking himself how people connect with each other, broke it down into ancient, modern, and contemporary forms of connection, and explored how Buildspace could build upon that. All of this fed into a grander narrative that eventually became the 2424 livestream, emails, and landing pages. The writing was the last step — the thinking came first.

The iterating happens in writing tools (Jeff uses Ulysses). He and Farza would jam on different versions: "We shut down our company for a month." "I became a monk for a month." Each version tested a different angle on the same underlying intent. Some versions were personal to Farza's founder story, others were more institutional. The final version lived at buildspace.so and was a long-form read — "If you really want to understand where our head is at, this is actually a pretty good read."

## The Venn Diagram: Finding Your Voice

Keep it simple: make something, observe what people like, notice what you like, and work to make that intersection bigger. It will never be 100% overlap, but you can keep working toward it. Your brand voice strengthens naturally through this process — it's not something you engineer upfront, it emerges from repeated iteration.

For creators who are eclectic and resist narrowing to one niche: the question is what do you actually want right now? If you want listeners for your music, your channel should make that clear. The creativity comes in being eclectic in *how* you tell the story of that one thing, not in scattering across many things.

## Metrics That Matter

When you're posting early on, don't focus on raw impressions. Look at the ratio of engagement to impressions. If 100 people saw your post and 10 liked it, that's a 10% engagement rate — not bad at all. If your engagement ratio is healthy but reach is low, the content is working and you need distribution. If reach is high but engagement is low, go back to fundamentals: are you communicating clearly? Is this authentic? Then start iterating on specifics like hooks for the platform you're on.

## Show vs. Tell

When selling a service or product, lean 80% toward showing and 20% toward describing benefits. Showing is faster to consume and more convincing. And when thinking about content length — whether an email or a video — it's not the word count or runtime that makes something feel long. It's the pacing. You can hack pacing to make long content feel short.

## Writing Is the Cheapest Skill to Develop

Writing requires no camera, no equipment, no budget. "You can literally write on the beach sand if you need to practice." It's the easiest and cheapest creative skill to develop, and it underlies everything else — landing pages, emails, video scripts, ads, cold outreach. Master writing and every other medium gets easier.

Keep an open mind about what works across platforms. What works on Twitter may not work on Instagram. Test, observe, and kill whatever doesn't work. The willingness to cut what isn't working is just as important as the ability to create.
