# DMW Class 0: Why Design, Marketing, and Writing Matter

This is the introductory session (Class Zero) of DMW — Design, Marketing, and Writing — a multi-week course taught at Buildspace SF2. The session is led by two instructors: one who handles everything design and user-facing at Buildspace (hoodies, stickers, the operating system Chrome homepage, websites, application flows), and Jeffrey, who handles story and writing — the narrative layer of everything Buildspace puts out. The course split is roughly 60/40 between the two.

## The Core Premise

Design, marketing, and writing are key ingredients for getting your story out to the world, regardless of what you're building — apps, music, films, YouTube channels, or anything else. Even a basic understanding of the fundamental principles in these three disciplines will take you surprisingly far. The critical gap to close is between **how you want to be perceived** and **how your audience actually perceives you**. That gap is where most builders lose, especially in early stages when you're starting out or trying to reach more people with an existing product.

The sessions draw from roughly a decade of experience in education, distilling lessons, learnings, and mistakes into frameworks others can use. The promise: even if you make the same mistakes, your recovery time will be dramatically shorter.

The balance is conceptual rather than tool-specific — not "how to use Framer or Figma or Adobe Premiere" but the thinking behind effective design, marketing, and writing. Practical sessions where participants bring their own work for critique are built in as well.

## Eyes Open: Building an Inspiration Practice

The single most important takeaway from Class Zero is this: **inspiration is literally all around you, and you need to be actively collecting it.**

The instructor's personal workflow is intensely visual. Walking into a coffee shop, he photographs the hats on display. He examines a coffee bag and captures two things simultaneously: what works (the art is catchy, it stands out among other bags) and what doesn't (a specific text treatment that could be done better). Every screenshot becomes a reference — when he looks at it later, the composition reminds him of both the positive and the negative lesson.

This extends to every platform. Browsing TikTok, Twitter, Instagram — taking screenshots and saving videos constantly. The key mental shift is moving from mindless scrolling to **intentional scrolling**: every time you stop on something after scrolling for a while, ask yourself what about this specific video, post, tweet, or image actually got you to stop. Building that analytical muscle day in and day out is the practice.

There's a practical infrastructure benefit too. Apple indexes screenshots, so typing "hats" into the photo search surfaces all 892 hat screenshots taken over time. The Buildspace hoodies were designed in a 24-hour end-to-end effort that started with screenshots, pulled color references from them, cross-referenced Pinterest boards, and moved straight to execution. The workflow isn't prescriptive — it's visual because the instructor is visual — but the principle applies to musicians (songs that drew you to an album), filmmakers, writers, anyone.

## Case Studies: What Worked and Why

### Eye Mouth Eye Experiment

About 19 young people (ages 16-21) ran a coordinated experiment on Twitter during the peak of Clubhouse hype. They all changed their profile pictures and bios to a mysterious pattern — the eye-mouth-eye symbol. The timing was deliberate: VCs were desperately searching for "the next big thing" to invest in, and suddenly these coordinated mysterious accounts looked like they were up to something.

They set up a waitlist site with a twist: donating to specific charitable causes would bump you up the waitlist. VCs poured in hundreds of thousands of dollars. The reveal was the point itself — demonstrating how irrational the hype cycle had become, where people would donate massive sums to a cause attached to a vague app just because of coordinated social signals. The experiment generated enormous attention because it exploited perfect timing and the psychological patterns of FOMO in the investment community.

### Rabbit R1: Anatomy of a Hardware Launch

The Rabbit R1 — a handheld AI-powered pocket device with a camera (GPT Vision), voice interface, and cellular connectivity for ordering services like DoorDash — went from 2,000 YouTube subscribers and modest views to 29.1K subscribers and 5 million views on their keynote. The founder said they would have been happy with 500 pre-orders; they hit 60,000.

Why it worked, broken down:

- **Timing**: AI hardware during an AI software boom. Most companies were doing AI software; an indie company doing AI hardware stood out immediately.
- **Novel framing**: They introduced the concept of a "Large Action Model" — not just processing language but taking actions based on language models. New terminology that captured something genuinely different.
- **Physical design**: Teenage Engineering designed the hardware, which made it visually distinctive and shareable. MKBHD covered it. Tech TikTok covered it.
- **Pricing strategy**: $199 one-time payment, no subscription. In a world drowning in SaaS, a flat price was a contrarian move that removed friction and became a talking point itself.
- **Product-first launch**: They had a well-flushed-out keynote and a real product demonstration. The substance backed up the attention.

### Mini Katana: The Content Factory

A company selling small decorative swords — an absurdly niche product — generated hundreds of millions in revenue through a pure content strategy. The founder hired 8-10 content creators. Every day at 8 AM, he'd send scripts. He'd approve the ones he liked, kill the rest, and the creators would make and post videos. That was the entire marketing strategy. No other paid marketing. A solo operator running a content factory, and the niche specificity was the strength — people who were into it were *really* into it.

### Mylene: From 580 to 108K Followers

A Buildspace participant went from about 580 followers to 108,000 in roughly two to three weeks. She had been making content before the inflection point — it wasn't that she started from nothing. The shift was a series called "23 Lessons from 2023 by a 20-Something Year Old." One of them blew up, and then people wanted to watch all of them. The lesson: "Make it very simple and obvious for people to understand what you're doing." Her page functioned like a movie trailer — each post was scannable and immediately clear in its premise.

### Prady's Tweet: Timing Myths

A Buildspace student was about to post a tweet on Monday because "Monday is the best time to post on Twitter." It was Friday. The instructor pushed back: if fewer people are posting on weekends, you're competing against a smaller field — that's *better*, not worse. Prady posted on Sunday. It hit 3 million views. He had 800 followers at the time. The content was good, people found value, they shared and engaged. Timing doesn't make or break content — quality does.

## Mental Models

### Chopping Wood, Collecting Sawdust

As you work — as you "cut wood" — there's sawdust accumulating around you. That sawdust is content. The model says: show people your process. If you're making music, live stream making a beat. If you're coding, share the build process. You're already doing the work; the sawdust is free. The key is incorporating content creation into your existing workflow rather than treating it as a separate, context-switching activity.

### The Barber's Dilemma

A barber cutting hair 10 hours a day sees Gen Z barbers blowing up on TikTok and wants to compete but has zero time to "grind on socials." The solution isn't to carve out separate content time — it's to layer content onto the work already happening:

- **Film the haircuts.** You're already cutting hair. Add a camera.
- **Before and afters.** Offer a $5 discount for permission to film. Customers save money, you get content.
- **Barber Reacts.** Tell followers to tag you with bad haircuts. React to them.
- **"I'll do what the comments say."** Let the audience direct the next haircut. This generates massive engagement.
- **Barber Talk.** Comedy content layered on the service — spraying water on someone's head without stopping, spinning the chair randomly. Genuinely funny, requires zero extra setup.

The underlying principle: "Can you incorporate content into your existing workflows?" The DoorDash delivery person who strapped a camera to his bike and filmed all his deliveries is the same idea — already doing the job, just adding a layer that costs almost nothing.

### Don't Be Afraid to Do Cringe Shit

Drew Walls made "target run" videos on TikTok — setting up a tripod, filming himself doing mundane activities with dramatic editing. People mocked him for months. "This is so stupid." "Why the fuck would you spend this much time to do this?" He kept going. Then Drake made a Drew Walls-style video, validating the entire format. After that, ESPN and the NFL signed him for $140,000 to create content around playoff games — essentially "Day in My Life: Getting Ready for the Game" in the Drew Walls style. The video hit 20 million views. Other major creators started copying the format.

"Cringe shit can actually, if you have that much conviction in it, lead to something much bigger."

## The Internet Has Changed Everything

A thought exercise worth doing for your own domain: how different would it have been to do what you're doing 20 or 25 years ago? For musicians, the contrast is stark — hustling on streets for 10 hours distributing CDs versus having infinite digital distribution channels today.

### Lo-fi Girl: A Case in Distribution

Lo-fi Girl started as a faceless YouTube channel run by someone known only as "Dimitri" from his dorm room. Over time, through pure consistency, it grew into Lo-fi Girl Records — an actual label that lo-fi artists sign with. Getting a song featured on the stream is meaningful because 12,000 people are watching simultaneously. The channel now has a merch store, a record label, and album releases.

A critical strategic decision: Lo-fi Girl took the stance that all music on the channel could be repurposed freely, no cost, no copyright claims. Many people initially said "this sucks" as a business model. But it became extraordinary distribution for the artists. Some have parlayed lo-fi exposure into gaming music and other opportunities. The ecosystem has since spawned niche variants — Hindi lo-fi, Catholic lo-fi, and countless others. For musicians in the lo-fi space, the play is simple: find your niche channel, reach out, offer your tracks for free featuring, and tap into their existing audience.

### The Attention Landscape

Billboards in Times Square are expensive because of the volume of attention passing through. The digital equivalent is understanding where attention concentrates on each platform. On Instagram, that's shifted heavily to Reels — for many users, 70% of their Instagram time is scrolling Reels. The Explore page used to be the attention hub; now it's secondary.

The framework: **Figure out your audience. Figure out where your audience resides. Figure out the avenues of getting attention on that specific platform.** This might be Twitter, TikTok, Instagram Reels, Hacker News, Nextdoor, Facebook Groups — it depends entirely on who you're trying to reach. Don't default to what's popular; go where your specific audience actually spends time.

## Practical Principles

**Don't overcomplicate shit.** The most common question is "Should I use Framer or Figma? Adobe Premiere or Final Cut? Twitter or TikTok?" The answer: pick a path and go. Optimize for time to ship. The Buildspace landing page went from a hand-drawn sketch on a whiteboard directly to a Framer build. "I know what my level of skill is and how much it would require for me to go from A to B. For me, going from here to here was not that challenging, so I just went and did it." Figure out your own thresholds and optimize for speed above all else.

**It's free and unlimited.** You do not get charged to post on Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, or Hacker News. No platform penalizes you for posting more than once a day — why would a social platform penalize its own users for creating more content? They want you to be consistent. They want you to add value to the network. The fastest growth the instructor has personally experienced came from posting three to five times a day, roughly evenly spaced across 24 hours.

**Skills transfer across platforms.** With a "massive asterisk," the skills are very transferable from one platform and medium to another. Don't overthink it in the beginning — as you do more, you gather data on what resonates and what doesn't, and you adapt.

**Don't fetishize going viral.** The goal is not virality. The goal is showing up consistently — like showing up to the gym — and learning and evaluating. How is your content doing? Are people engaging or not? Use the analytics these platforms provide. The real question is: who is interested in your stuff? Even if only 20 people engage, but they're from a niche, influential crowd, that matters more than raw numbers.

**"Do not be Nolan on day one."** Very few people can disappear for three years and drop a trailer that fills theaters. Christopher Nolan can. You almost certainly cannot. It's actually beneficial to tell people what you're working on, because you may have one or ten true fans looking to you for inspiration. Showing them your process and sharing authentically builds trust. "There's no fucking downside of putting out a song" — or a post, or a video, or a project. It may blow up tomorrow, or it may blow up years later, like CKay's "Love Nwantiti" which was made six years before it took over TikTok and changed his life.

**Form small analysis groups.** Have two or three people you share interesting content with and analyze what works and what doesn't. This decentralizes your workload — different people surface different things from different corners of the internet. The Buildspace team has "too many little groups" where they share TikToks, goof around, but also sit down and ask "Why did this work? Why did that work?"

**Make your work composable.** Subi Tech built an AI Paul Graham chatbot using Wave2Lip for lip syncing and ElevenLabs for voice. Prady (another student) then built on top of it with a better lip-syncing model, making it nearly indistinguishable from real video. That composability — building things other people can build on top of — creates compounding value and attention.

**Capture genuine reactions.** The Buildspace video that actually went viral wasn't about Buildspace at all — it was two people reviewing an Apple feature with a genuinely amazed reaction (which turned out to be a fake feature, generating even more engagement as people tried it and came back to comment that it didn't work). Authentic excitement and genuine surprise translate powerfully on camera.

## Content Ideas from the Composability Discussion

The session brainstormed productizing the AI Paul Graham concept: spinning up bots for other personalities (Elon, Zuckerberg, Joe Rogan, IShowSpeed) to reach different audience bubbles; creating an AI Cameo service ("Ask Taylor Swift Anything"); offering a service that turns any YouTube channel or podcast into a 24/7 interactive stream; taking someone's decade of written articles and converting them into video content using their voice and likeness; AI characters reading children's books. The landscape of AI-generated personality content is expanding rapidly — "anytime I come across a Rogan video, I don't know if it's actually from the podcast or if it's AI generated."
