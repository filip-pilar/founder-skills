# Branding 101: Let's Get Personal

This is DMW Class 6, focused on building your personal brand as a builder. The lecture delivers three concrete takeaways: how to write a strong social bio, what to post and how to stay consistent, and how to begin crafting your own voice. The session is hands-on — the instructor pulls up real participants' profiles, critiques them live, and rewrites bios on the spot using browser developer tools.

## Your Bio Is a Handshake

The lecture opens with a simple reframing: think of your social bio as a party introduction. When you meet someone new, they ask "what do you do?" — and your bio is that answer, delivered at scale. New people encounter your profile constantly. If something blows up, strangers are meeting you by the second. Your bio needs to help them understand you immediately.

The instructor pulls up several participants' bios to illustrate what goes wrong. One reads "Delusion is the solution." Another says "Walking along the pathless path." A third is just a cryptic project name with no context. The room laughs — but the point lands. These bios try to capture something complex or philosophical about their creators, but they fail the party test. If someone introduced themselves that way at a gathering, you'd have no idea what to do with it.

The antidote is radical simplicity. The instructor shows a series of accounts that nail it:

**Sebastian** — a graphic designer whose bio simply says "Graphic designer, open for commissions." You visit his Instagram and see excellent design work. You instantly know how to engage with him.

**Sean Wasabi** — bio says "Music producer." That's it. You go to Spotify and find music. No mystery, no friction.

**David Senra** (Founders Podcast) — "Learn from history's greatest entrepreneurs. Every week I read a biography of an entrepreneur and tell you what I learned. 340 biographies down, a thousand to go." Clear value proposition, clear format, even a progress marker that builds credibility.

**Duolingo's Twitter** — "Free language education for the world, available on Android, iOS, and the web." Completely straightforward.

The takeaway is blunt: "This is not the place to be creative." Your bio should state what you do in the simplest possible terms. You are more complex than a one-liner — of course. But the simplified version is what earns you the chance to reveal that complexity. If the simple introduction intrigues someone, they'll ask deeper questions. If it confuses them, they scroll past.

## Rewriting Bios Live

The instructor demonstrates a practical technique: open your browser's developer console, type `document.designMode = "on"`, and you can directly edit any text on a webpage. He uses this to rewrite participants' bios in real time, showing how the edit would look on the actual platform.

Rohit's bio gets reworked from "Rohu Films" (which communicates almost nothing) to "Building a school to teach anyone how to make better films." Immediately, the profile tells a story. A visitor would naturally want to check out the school, scroll the feed, or reach out about collaboration.

The instructor also highlights bios that already work well. Kat's profile says "Music producer" — simple, effective. Niyati's Instagram bio reads "Navigating brown girl trauma" — clear and specific to her platform. The key principle is to adapt your bio to each platform but keep the core message consistent across all of them, so that wherever people find you, they understand who you are and what you do.

For Samia's bio, the instructor applies the writing principle from an earlier lecture: good writing is erasing things. Her bio includes her age (20), location journey (Delhi to San Francisco), and what she makes (Hindi pop music). The group workshopped it down: lead with "Making Hindi pop music," follow with "Moved from Delhi to San Francisco to pursue music full-time." The age doesn't add credibility at 20 the way it would at 18. The origin story — moving countries to pursue music — is the genuinely interesting detail.

## Your Feed Must Reinforce Your Bio

Once your bio is clear, it creates a natural expectation for what your feed should contain. This is where many people fall apart — the bio says one thing, but the feed is incoherent.

The instructor frames it as anticipating questions. If Rohit's bio says he's building a film school, people will naturally wonder: Why a film school? What kind of films? How do I join? Is he qualified? His feed should be answering these questions. Posts about his teaching process, filmmaking tips, progress building the school, student results — all of this reinforces the bio and deepens the connection.

Kat posted "I quit my tech job to make music full time" — which instantly answers one of the anticipated questions a new visitor would have. That single post does real work.

Edgar's account (AI Reality TV) has a solid bio — "Watch and join the first AI reality TV show" — but the feed doesn't match. The thumbnails and imagery don't visually communicate what AI Reality TV looks like. The group suggests the cover images should show scenes from the actual show. Contrast this with Sean Wasabi's feed, where every post visually screams "music." You see him playing instruments, performing, creating. The bio and the feed tell the same story.

Samia's feed has a similar problem: her bio says she makes music, but her Instagram grid looks more like an art or aesthetics page. A visitor wouldn't necessarily know she's a musician from scrolling the feed alone.

The principle is congruence. "Everything needs to be hyper-focused." Bio and feed must point in the same direction.

## Credibility Without a Large Following

The question of credibility comes up — how do you build trust when you're just starting out? The instructor makes an important distinction: follower count is one signal, but engagement rate is often more telling. There are accounts with 80,000+ followers where every post gets minimal engagement, which actually damages credibility because it suggests bots or purchased followers.

For someone early in their journey, credibility comes from the quality and consistency of the content itself, social proof like testimonials, and the depth of expertise visible in the feed. You don't need a massive audience to be credible — you need coherence between what you claim and what you show.

## Don't Delay Building an Audience

A critical strategic point: start building your audience now, while you're still working on your project. There's a high chance your specific project will change, but the audience you build travels with you. "Every person who starts to believe in you can be on a journey" — they're following you, not just your current product. If you wait until your project is "ready" to start posting, you've lost months of potential audience growth.

## Crafting Your Voice

The third pillar of the lecture addresses voice — how you say things, not just what you say. The instructor uses Duolingo's Twitter as the primary example. Their bio is completely straightforward, but their content is wild: pop culture references, memes about their aggressive push notifications, unhinged TikToks. This voice didn't appear overnight. Duolingo first established crystal-clear messaging about what they are, and only after the audience understood the product did they earn the freedom to play.

"You really cannot skip steps to get here." If your audience doesn't yet know what you do, avant-garde content will confuse rather than delight. Clarity first, personality second.

## The Buildspace Dark Ages

The instructor shares buildspace's own messy history to demonstrate that nobody starts with a perfect feed. Buildspace's bio is "We're a place where people build cool shit" — and their current feed reflects that, showing builders and their projects. But it wasn't always this way.

He pulls up old posts: random meme content ("Startups be like..."), a fake phone notification gag, content that had no clear connection to buildspace's mission. There was a period where the team was "not really sure what we're shipping." The turnaround came when they committed to coherence — everything they posted had to relate to people building things.

The earliest posts that performed best were the simplest and clearest. One tweet stating their community size and mission got massive engagement. A straightforward announcement about campus lectures being made public did well on YouTube because it was "really, really clear."

Even now, as buildspace expands to YouTube, they're starting from ground zero on that platform and have to re-establish clarity for a new audience. The work of being clear never fully ends.

## What to Post on Your Personal Account

For personal accounts that support what you're building, the instructor offers two categories:

**Share what you're learning.** Farza's account models this — he tweets about lessons from buildspace's move to YouTube, insights from the process. He functions as "the friend of buildspace," someone who hypes up the work without it feeling like a corporate sales pitch. Think of that friend who convinces you to watch shows — you should be that friend for your own work.

**Share what you've become an expert in.** Farza also tweets about selling authentically, a topic he's developed real expertise in. When you have genuine knowledge, sharing it builds both credibility and audience.

## Truth as a Content Strategy

The instructor emphasizes that authenticity and confession are powerful content tools. "A little bit of confession can actually gain a lot of acceptance." He shows several buildspace posts where honesty about mistakes or struggles drove strong engagement:

- A post where Farza was transparent about what went wrong in 2023
- Posts admitting mistakes and sharing lessons learned
- A candid email acknowledging "we were dumb, don't beat us"

These resonate because the audience relates — everyone knows that building things is genuinely hard. Pretending otherwise creates distance. Admitting it creates connection.

## The Core Framework

The lecture builds a sequential framework that should be followed in order:

1. **Clear bio** — State what you do in the simplest possible terms. No poetry, no mystery. Adapt per platform, but keep the core consistent.
2. **Congruent feed** — Every post should reinforce your bio. Anticipate the questions a new visitor would ask and let your content answer them.
3. **Find your voice** — Only after clarity is established can you layer in personality, humor, and stylistic experimentation.

The instructor explicitly warns against skipping to step three. Storytelling, cold email optimization, and advanced content strategy are all downstream of these fundamentals. "If you just start doing these three things, it's going to flow to everything else."
