# Design 101: How to Take Your Designs to the Next Level

## What Design Actually Is

Design is the holistic experience you provide to someone end to end. It's not just aesthetics — it's how something works as a whole. The speaker grew up in a family of designers (both parents designed houses and communities), where meticulous attention to every detail was instilled from a young age. That upbringing shaped a core conviction: "It's not just what it looks and feels like, it's how it actually works as a whole."

## The Holy Trinity of Design: Useful, Usable, Beautiful

The best designs satisfy three criteria, and the order matters enormously.

**1. Useful (start here).** The design must solve a real problem or meet a genuine need. If it's not useful, it doesn't matter how usable or beautiful it is. This connects directly to whatever you're building — what problem does it solve, what need does it meet for the end user? Usefulness is the foundation; without it, everything else is cosmetic.

**2. Usable.** Once something is useful, make it easy to interact with. "They're not here to solve a fucking puzzle or mystery." People found something useful — now they just want to use it. Don't make them work hard to figure out how to interact with it. If it's difficult to use, they'll churn. You can verify this by looking at analytics: if people aren't engaging, that's your signal. This applies beyond web and app design — to music, video, film, art. If you put out a video that looks aesthetically pleasing but nobody interacts with it, that tells you it wasn't useful or usable enough.

**3. Beautiful (last).** Make it aesthetically pleasing, but never sacrifice usability or usefulness in the pursuit of beauty. Starting with beauty rather than usefulness is "no different than the shit show we see on Dribbble" — essentially snake oil salesmanship.

A key insight from the Q&A: when you nail usefulness and usability, ideas for making it beautiful tend to emerge naturally during the process. Musicians experience this — while crafting a beat and adding lyrics, they're already picturing the aesthetic of the music video. But don't skip the earlier steps. "Do not rob yourself of this process."

## Don't Obsess Over Tools

Tools are great only if they push you forward. People waste enormous time evaluating tools instead of creating. "Should I use Premiere Pro or DaVinci Resolve? Stop. Just start somewhere familiar and go."

The calculus is simple: if learning a new tool takes two months and then implementing takes two weeks, that's ten weeks you could have spent getting feedback. Start with what you already know, even if it's Canva or CapCut. The speaker's own starting point is often pen and paper.

A powerful example: Madlib, one of the greatest producers of all time, has used nothing but an iPad and GarageBand for the past decade. "You would never tell that those were the tools he was using." Mastery of a simple tool beats dabbling with a complex one.

The principle: "Would you fall in love with the fucking pencil? No. Same thing." Don't fall in love with tools. When a genuinely better tool comes along (for the speaker, Framer replaced Webflow because it combined the best of Figma and Webflow with code support), commit and move on. But don't spend days evaluating when you could be shipping.

## The CHATS Framework

A simple, memorable framework for making a useful and usable design aesthetically pleasing. Each letter maps to a fundamental design principle.

### C — Color and Contrast

Poor color choices and low contrast make designs unreadable. The speaker showed a slide with bad color and bad contrast — the audience immediately recognized it was hard to read. Fix: increase contrast first. Even with acceptable colors, if contrast is off, the design fails. Once contrast is solid, you have a workable palette to experiment with.

A broader point about developing a "design eye": because this generation is so internet-native, most people already have decent intuition about what looks good. The key is being intentional — when something stops your scroll, take a moment of self-reflection to understand *what* about it hooked you, then continue scrolling. That moment of reflection is what trains the eye.

### H — Hierarchy

If there's no obvious visual guidance, viewers default to reading top-to-bottom, left-to-right (right-to-left in Arabic-reading countries). Make hierarchy explicit. "It's as if you're feeding a baby mush carrots — read this one first, then read the rest." Direct the viewer's attention deliberately.

### A — Alignment

Align your elements. Even if color, contrast, and hierarchy are correct, misaligned content looks like trash. Once you understand alignment fundamentals, you earn the autonomy to break the rules intentionally. Without understanding the fundamentals, "you're just throwing stuff at the wall and seeing what sticks."

### T — Typography

Make intentional choices about typefaces. Don't use three different fonts in one design — even if everything else checks out, inconsistent typography creates visual noise. Stick to one, at most two different typefaces. Keep it simple and deliberate.

### S — Spacing (Letter Spacing and Line Spacing)

Both letter spacing (space between characters) and line spacing (space between lines) matter. Design school calls these "leading" and "kerning" — but the concepts are simple. Bad line spacing makes content feel cramped and unreadable. Too much spacing feels empty and disconnected. Give things space to breathe, but be intentional about how much. The goal is comfortable reading and clear visual separation between components.

### Consistency

After mastering the CHATS elements, aim for consistency. You want people to associate your visual style with you. The speaker shared that people regularly tag buildspace's team on Twitter with "random black slides with white text in the middle" because that look is so iconic to the brand — even when it's not actually them. That level of recognition is what consistency builds. In the beginning, consistency takes a back seat to exploration — you need to iterate and experiment until you find what works, then lock in and be consistent.

## The Art of Design: Process Over Polish

The speaker walked through their actual creative process for a recent buildspace promotional video to demystify how professional-quality work gets made with a small team and tight timelines.

### Start With Emotion and Concept

Everything begins with defining the emotion you want the audience to feel. For the buildspace video, the core emotion was: people are posting their work and not getting found. The product thesis is "find and be found" — so the video needed to convey that even two or three genuine views that move you forward are worth more than vanity metrics, and this product enables that.

The process started with rough sketches at a desk — mapping out the emotional journey, the story beats, what the video needs to achieve. This happened within 15 minutes of the initial conversation with the team.

### Move Through Fidelity Levels Quickly

From pen and paper, the next step wasn't Figma — it was Excalidraw, a lightweight canvas tool that feels like digital pen and paper. Rough flow charts, user journeys, basic layout. Get feedback from trusted teammates at each stage. Then move to rough scripts (still messy, still figuring out what to add and delete). Then refine.

The key insight: "I could have very well gone into Figma, spent two, three days on it, but again, I'm robbing myself of that." The speaker made this mistake repeatedly in their teens and early twenties. Speed through low-fidelity stages. Get feedback early and often.

### Use References Intentionally

The team spent 8-10 hours consuming reference material — commercials, animations, different visual approaches. They landed on two primary references: a Google Super Bowl ad (circa 2010) that told a love story through a search box, capturing the exact emotional arc they wanted, and A24's loading animation for visual style. From those references, they applied their own artistic interpretation.

Building a reference library is a background process that develops over years — screenshots, saved content, mental catalog. Apple's photo surfacing helps resurface old saves. For those starting fresh: you're already scrolling and consuming content, just be intentional about saving and noting what resonates.

### Trust Your Strengths and Optimize for Speed

When the team needed animation, the speaker didn't spend 10 hours learning After Effects. They used Framer (the tool they already mastered), built a reference animation in two minutes, shared it with a collaborator who specializes in animation, and let that person apply their artistic touch. "I'm always trying to cut my time the shortest."

The same principle applied to sound design — when a team member (Kieran) shared a track, the speaker immediately knew it was right for the end credits sequence. They'd been storing the idea of an end credits moment for months, waiting for the right opportunity.

### Ship Fast, Learn, Move On

The team of five shipped the entire promotional video in about two weeks — a timeline that compares to Apple spending six months with a team of 60 on a keynote. The shipped buildspace profile product (shown in the video) flopped — "it was fucking trash" — but the rapid execution meant they learned quickly without overinvesting. "We're not spending all this time making it pretty, creating the perfect flow, like interactions in Figma. No, just don't do that. Not worth it."

## Know Your Audience

The speaker compared Netflix's clean, minimal interface (designed for a defined North American audience) with iQIYI, a Chinese streaming app packed with live comments, share-to-earn prices, screenshot tools, GIF recording, and per-video Dolby Atmos purchases. Neither is wrong — they're designed for fundamentally different user behaviors and infrastructure. In China, microtransactions are normal (you can read 70% of a book free, then pay pennies per thousand words), enabled by banking infrastructure that supports sub-penny transactions.

The lesson: understand who you're building for and design accordingly. This extends to content creation. The speaker coached a creator who was selling Pantene ads one day and promoting a competing product the next — destroying audience trust through inconsistency. Know your audience, be consistent in what you deliver to them, and be authentic. "They can sift through the bullshit pretty easily."

## Aim for Iteration, Not Perfection

A university photography class was split into two groups. Group one had to produce a single incredible photo for the entire semester to earn an A. Group two had to take 100 photos in 100 days — regardless of quality — for the same grade. Group two produced far better photographs. They simply got better through repetition.

The same principle applies to everything: "Don't aim for perfection, aim for iteration."

## The Variable Lottery Tickets Mental Model

The internet is a giant lottery. Every post is a ticket. The math is straightforward: if you can buy one Powerball ticket for $2 or eight tickets for $5, everyone takes the eight tickets. Posting works the same way.

If you've already created something — a YouTube video, a podcast, a song — the hard work is done. Cross-posting to Reddit, Hacker News, niche communities, or reformatting as short-form clips costs almost nothing compared to the original creation effort. Each cross-post is another lottery ticket.

"You've built this house — let's create more doors for people to come in." One door is YouTube search. Reddit can be another. Hacker News another. Worst case: nobody walks through a particular door, which is the same outcome as never posting there. Best case: "asymmetric upside" — one post catches fire and drives massive traffic back to your work.

The speaker demonstrated this by reviewing a student's no-code podcast video, which had high-quality content but a weak thumbnail. Fixing the thumbnail (the first thing searchers see) and cross-posting to Bubble, low-code, and no-code communities would multiply the reach for minimal additional effort. "You've already done the work. Just get as many different tickets as you can."

## The Baby Bolt Mental Model

Imagine a baby learning to walk. The baby crawls, sees everyone around them walking, and thinks "I could do that too." The baby gets up, takes steps, falls. But the baby doesn't look around and despair that everyone else is walking and running. Babies don't have that context.

Now imagine if that baby had full awareness of Usain Bolt running at 9.8 seconds — the baby would think "how am I ever going to get there?" and might never take a step at all.

"You see how crazy that sounds, but you see how all of you guys do that."

Everyone in the room has full context on greatness — Jobs, Gates, Swift, Drake, whoever their idols are. That context, which should be inspirational, instead becomes paralyzing. "Having full context and understanding on what it takes to be great will make you take 10 times longer to take your first step."

The antidote: don't compare yourself to the endpoint. Don't care if people laugh when you fall. Lean on others who can help. Focus only on stringing together your first few steps. Stop overthinking. "A baby is not Bolt."

## Student Work Reviews

The lecture included live reviews of student work with actionable feedback:

**Long-form Twitter post (bookmarkable content).** The speaker didn't read the full post but bookmarked it immediately — which was exactly the right outcome. Posts dense with free value and information are designed to be bookmarked, not necessarily liked. The speaker and Jeff (buildspace co-founder) used to intentionally design posts for specific engagement actions: some for bookmarks (20-30 likes but hundreds of bookmarks), some for shares, etc. "All by design."

**NFC device landing page.** The student's landing page felt unbalanced — alignment was off (pre-order button centered while text was left-aligned). More critically, the copy said "designed against addiction," which is meaningless to a first-time visitor. The speaker redesigned the page in two minutes, simplifying it to: there are 100 units, it ships in March, you can block anything with a tap, it's an NFC device that lets you block distractions. Explicit, concrete, scannable. Don't make visitors work to understand what you're selling.

**No-code podcast.** High-quality content — the speaker saved it to a playlist. The feedback was focused entirely on distribution: fix the thumbnail (primary discovery surface on YouTube search), improve the title, and cross-post to communities where the target audience already hangs out (Bubble forums, no-code subreddits, Hacker News). The content is the hard part; distribution is cheap additional effort.

## On Branding and Naming

When a student asked about whether to choose an imaginative vs. descriptive product name, the advice was blunt: "How long have you spent on it? Just pick one and go." Sleep on it — take a few candidates to bed, wake up with clarity. Pick names where domains and handles are available. Don't overthink it. Facebook became Meta after nearly two decades. You can always rename later.
