# What Is Good Design

## The Holy Trinity: Useful, Usable, Beautiful

Good design comes down to three qualities, in strict priority order: useful, usable, and beautiful. All three matter, but they are not equal — there's a clear hierarchy, and the order you tackle them in determines whether you end up with something real or something that just looks good on Dribbble.

**Useful** is the foundation. The design must solve a problem or meet a need for the user. If it isn't useful, nothing else matters — no amount of usability polish or visual beauty will save it. This connects directly to the core question every builder should be asking: what problem does this solve, and what need does it meet for the person using it?

**Usable** comes second. Once something is useful, the person using it should not have to work hard to figure out how to interact with it. "They're not here to solve a fucking puzzle or mystery." They found something useful — now they just want to use it. If it's difficult to use, people churn. The signal is often right there in your analytics: a video no one engages with, a product people bounce from — that's the feedback that usefulness or usability is missing.

**Beautiful** comes last. Aesthetic pleasure and delight matter, but only after the first two are locked in. "Starting here is no different than the shit show we see on Dribbble." Starting with beauty before usefulness is, in the speaker's words, "no different than just being a snake oil salesman." The critical discipline is to not sacrifice usability or usefulness in the pursuit of making something look good.

These three principles apply universally — not just to web or app design, but to music, video, film, art, fashion, any creative domain. The question of how usability applies to your specific medium is one every builder needs to answer for themselves.

## Beauty Doesn't Just Happen — But the Process Feeds It

Someone asked whether nailing usefulness and usability naturally produces beauty on its own. The answer is nuanced: in the pursuit of making something useful and usable, you'll already generate ideas about how to make it beautiful. Musicians crafting a beat and writing lyrics are already picturing the aesthetic of the music video. That creative momentum is real. But the speaker's strong advice is to not skip the process — "do not rob yourself of this process." Work through useful and usable deliberately before jumping to the visual polish.

## Don't Obsess Over Tools

A common trap, especially among builders early in their journey, is spending days evaluating tools instead of starting. Should I use Premiere Pro or DaVinci Resolve? Figma or Framer? The speaker's position is blunt: stop. "Just start somewhere familiar and go." If that familiar place is Canva or CapCut, that's completely fine.

The math is simple: if learning a new tool takes two months and implementing takes two more weeks, that's ten weeks lost — ten weeks you could have spent getting real feedback. Start with what you know. Tools should push you forward, not become an obstacle to starting.

For the speaker, the starting point is often pen and paper. Literally sketching things out by hand, then getting feedback immediately.

## Speed and Feedback Over Perfection

The speaker walked through a real example from Buildspace's own process. The team was in Mexico City, brainstorming the next chapter for the company. Right after the conversation — within 15 minutes — the speaker sketched out an idea on paper and showed it to the team for feedback. Not a polished Figma mockup, not a pixel-perfect design. A rough sketch, shared immediately.

From there, the iteration moved to Excalidraw — a freeform canvas tool that feels like pen and paper but with digital flexibility for flowcharts and blocks. They roughed out user flows: how someone lands on the page, claims a username, navigates profiles. All of this happened in about half a day.

Only after getting feedback on the rough flows did they move to actual high-fidelity design — the polished pages for user profiles, company profiles, and so on. The final product shipped in about two weeks.

The idea itself flopped — "it was fucking trash" — but the point is that they learned fast because they didn't waste weeks on visual polish before validating the concept. The process was: sketch → rough wireframe → feedback → refine → ship → learn.

## Don't Create Unscalable Mountains in Your Head

When you overcomplicate the process — waiting for the perfect tool, the perfect mockup, the perfect moment to share — you create "unscalable mountains" in your head. The fix is to break things down and just start.

A related point about sharing work: many people are afraid to share early because they want others to envision the final product they're imagining. But this robs both you and your audience. "They're following you for the journey, not the destination." If you only show the polished end result, it's like showing just the last five minutes of a film where the hero sails off into the sunset — no one cares without the story of the ups and downs that got them there. Bring your audience along for the whole ride.

## Design Applied Beyond Screens

The lecture included a brief exchange about applying these principles to personal style — specifically, how do you "design" an outfit that meets the useful/usable/beautiful criteria? The speaker's take: it starts with intention. What are you trying to communicate? How do you want to be perceived? The speaker wears the same outfit every day as a deliberate, intentional choice. Others express personality through varied clothing. Either way, the key is being intentional rather than defaulting, and iterating based on feedback — the same design process applied to a different medium.
