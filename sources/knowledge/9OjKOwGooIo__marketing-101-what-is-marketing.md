# Marketing 101: What Is Marketing

This is the opening lecture of the DMW (Design, Marketing, Writing) series, led by Jeffrey and Stavon. It establishes a working definition of marketing and introduces four core frameworks that recur throughout the rest of the program. The session mixes short-form video breakdowns, real-world ad examples from the streets of San Francisco, and live critique of student work.

## What Marketing Actually Is

Marketing is not just content. It's not just building an audience. The definition the lecture anchors on has two parts:

**Marketing is a compelling way to share what you're doing with the world — and get people to do the thing you want them to do.**

The action component is critical. A lot of people make content that builds followers but never drives anyone to do anything beyond hitting follow. Real marketing has an intended action — buy this, sign up for this, try this, share this. Every time you create something that could be called marketing, you should know what action you want someone to take.

## The Four Frameworks

Each framework is tied to a specific emotional response it should trigger in the audience. They aren't checklists to run through while creating — they're most useful as analysis tools when reflecting on why something worked or diagnosing why something didn't. In practice, they layer on top of each other like ingredients in a dish. Sometimes you emphasize one heavily and strip back the rest; sometimes you blend several in harmony.

### 1. Curiosity Gap

**Target emotion:** "I must know what's next."

The first example is a TikTok where someone opens by saying they're inheriting 46 billion dollars from a man they've never met. The story pulls you in — it sounds real, the details are specific, and you need to know where this is going. The reveal: it's the plot of a book called *The Inheritance Games* by Jennifer Lynn Barnes. The video hit 6.3 million views. The book sold out quickly after.

This is a pattern where you create an open loop that the viewer cannot leave unresolved. You withhold the payoff just long enough to keep attention locked, then deliver it in a way that ties back to whatever you're actually promoting.

A product-side example is Spotify Wrapped. It shows you a number from last year and asks: will this year be higher or lower? That single question creates an instant curiosity gap. You have to find out. It works because it's personal — the gap is about *your* data.

One nuance raised in Q&A: curiosity gap can backfire. If the audience feels "rugged" (tricked) — like the bait had nothing to do with the payoff — it erodes trust. Whether this happens depends on the platform mindset. On TikTok, people expect entertainment and are more forgiving of creative hooks. On LinkedIn, they expect substance and will feel manipulated by the same tactic. The book example sits right on the edge — some people felt tricked, others found it clever. Platform and audience dictate how far you can stretch the gap.

**Practical note:** Study comments on TikTok and Instagram obsessively. The comments tell you exactly how people are reacting — what emotions they felt, where they got hooked, where they dropped off. If you're posting and not reading every comment, you're leaving insight on the table.

### 2. Storytelling

**Target emotion:** "I can understand this. I can relate to this."

The central example is a video about Lionel Messi that opens with footage of his head constantly moving during matches. It then introduces the concept of "scanning" — when a player looks away from the ball to take in extra information before receiving it. Messi scans an average of five times in the ten seconds before receiving the ball; the average Premier League forward does it 2.8 times. The video educates through narrative, building from observation to data to insight.

The reveal: the whole thing is marketing for Be Your Best, a VR training product that helps players improve their scanning. But the audience doesn't feel sold to, because the video delivers genuine knowledge wrapped in a story about one of the most famous athletes alive. Jeffrey noted that he and Stavon originally watched this video just to learn more about Messi while playing FIFA — the product pitch felt natural, not intrusive.

The power of storytelling is that it makes information memorable. You take something educational and embed it in narrative, and now people carry it with them. "All of you are gonna leave, and if somebody asks what makes Lionel Messi great, you're gonna be like, well actually, what makes him great is his scanning."

Storytelling often works best layered with other frameworks. The Messi video also has a curiosity gap (what does Messi do with his head that makes him great?), but the primary engine is narrative.

### 3. Contrast

**Target emotion:** "Damn, I've never seen anything like this."

The example is a TikTok that opens with a Fox News clip about millennials and Gen Zers preferring unemployment over unhappy jobs — then cuts to someone performing a song over it, blending the news footage into an original musical piece. It combines formats you'd never expect to see together. The curiosity gap is baked in (why is there a mic next to this news clip?), and the storytelling lives inside the song itself, but the dominant framework is contrast — you've never seen anything quite like this, so you stop scrolling.

However, contrast doesn't universally apply. In some niches, standing out too much works against you. The academic space is a clear example: things need to look official. If a research tool looks too flashy or unconventional, researchers won't trust it. Unriddle was cited as a product that succeeded partly because "it looks like something a legit researcher would use." In contexts where credibility depends on conforming to established aesthetics, contrast can hurt more than help.

The opposite of contrast — building on familiarity — can be equally powerful. The example here is Kaio (KO), a boxing app. Their marketing uses the familiar man-on-the-street interview format that already saturates TikTok and Instagram. They don't try to look different. Instead, they take a format people already stop to watch and inject their product into it: "How many punches do you think you can throw in 10 seconds?" The interviewee guesses 50, actually throws 45, and the host casually mentions the app that counted them. Curiosity gap is embedded (you're counting along), but the format is deliberately familiar, which reduces friction.

### 4. Value Proposition

**Target emotion:** "This is exactly what I need."

This framework is especially relevant for SaaS products and anything selling a clear utility. The key principle: be as specific as possible about the value you deliver.

A series of landing page headlines were compared:

- **Vague:** "A tool to manage your cloud using code." — Unclear benefit. Only makes sense if you already know the space.
- **Generic:** The classic "The all-in-one platform for [X]" copy. Jeffrey called this out explicitly: "I don't want to see any of this copy here. If in week five I see this, I'm going to chat with you privately."
- **Specific with numbers:** A headline that includes concrete quantities ("thousands of...") and paints a clear picture of what you get. This was the audience favorite because it creates an immediate mental image of the value.

A Pomodoro-style study app was shown as a strong example: simple product design with value props clearly laid out, targeted directly at students, with the line "learn more in less time." It works because the who (students) and the what (learn faster) are immediately obvious.

The general principle: if you're offering something that saves people time or money, do not be shy about stating that directly. Don't hide behind abstract language. Don't make people work to understand what you do.

## Frameworks as Ingredients, Not Rules

"I want you to take these frameworks, but I want you to start thinking of them as ingredients. And sometimes you want to emphasize one taste over another. Like if you're cooking a ribeye steak, you might want it to just be ribeye steak. So that might just be the value prop. You want to cut down noise on the other things. Sometimes it's a harmony of all of them."

The frameworks are not exhaustive — there are many more. These four are the foundational ones the DMW series builds on. The instruction is to explore beyond them: "Explore all the ingredients that make up your dish. Don't limit yourself to just those four."

Importantly, you don't consciously run through the frameworks while creating. They're most useful in retrospect. When you look at something that worked and ask why, you can break it down through these lenses. When something you made isn't working, you can diagnose what's missing — maybe there's no curiosity gap, no clear value prop, no story. The frameworks are analysis tools first, creation tools second.

## Platform Dictates Everything

The platform you're posting on determines the rules of engagement. TikTok demands speed — your hook needs to land in the first three to five seconds or you lose people. "The platform dictates your pace. TikTok is super fast. So you have essentially the hook needs to be in the first three to five seconds, or you're fucked."

Different platforms also come with different audience mindsets. LinkedIn users are looking for opportunities. TikTok users are looking to be entertained. The same piece of content can feel clever on one platform and manipulative on another. When choosing how aggressive to be with techniques like curiosity gap, consider where the audience's head is when they encounter your content.

Format matters too. A student's product demo video was critiqued for mixing landscape and portrait orientations and having low visual contrast that made it hard to see what was being shown. The feedback: if you're already investing time to create a video, spend the extra five minutes making it visually clean. Platform-native formatting (vertical for TikTok, proper contrast, readable text) is table stakes.

## Don't Filter Your Audience Too Early

A question came up about whether top-of-funnel content should be targeted narrowly or cast wide. The answer: don't filter too early.

The Messi video is a good example — it's ostensibly about soccer, but it hooks people who don't care about soccer at all because the story is intrinsically interesting. If a million people watch it and 10% check out your website and 10% of those convert, you still win by making the top of funnel as large as possible.

There's also a second-order effect: "People know other people." Someone who doesn't play soccer might watch the Messi video and send it to a friend who does. Content that delivers genuine value earns sharing even from people outside the target audience. If you immediately filter with something like "Are you a tennis player?" in the first two seconds, you lose everyone who isn't — including people who might have shared it with someone who is.

## Respect Attention, Add Value

Whatever you create — even a TikTok promoting your product — should add value to people's lives. "It's not just so they can sell more stuff, but you're respecting the people who give you their attention. And if you respect that, chances are you're going to reap benefits from that."

The Messi video works as marketing because it's a genuinely good piece of content about scanning in football. You learn something real. The product pitch at the end doesn't feel like a bait-and-switch because the preceding two minutes delivered actual knowledge.

## Word of Mouth and Shareability

Word of mouth was discussed in the context of how things cross the threshold from "I like this" to "I need to tell someone about this." Two conditions were identified:

1. **Strong voice.** The thing needs to feel like it has a distinct identity — not generic, not safe, but clearly *something*.
2. **Different enough to remark on.** You share things when they feel noteworthy. "Yo, check this out" requires that "this" stands out from the ambient noise.

Shareability can be designed. Stavon shared an example of a song that one person shared with him, he shared with four friends, and those friends shared further — organic spread driven by genuine enthusiasm. "If you're excited for the next time when you're driving the car and your buddies are with you and you can't wait to play that song and expose that for them, I think that in itself is a testament to how good your music is."

The concept of **cult classics** was raised — things like the game *Hotline Miami* or the band *Windows 96*. These aren't mass-market phenomena, but they last for a decade because the people who find them feel like "this was made for me." That feeling of personal resonance is what drives deep, sustained word of mouth. You don't need everyone to love it. You need a subset of people to feel it was made specifically for them, and they'll keep sharing it.

Trust is the foundation underneath all of this. Audiences that trust you will forgive experiments that don't land. "They'll actually cheer you on to fuck up so that they can be there to support you." Trust is built over time through authenticity and consistent value — it's not something you can hack with a single piece of content.

## Real-World Marketing Observation

A recurring theme: pay attention to marketing in the physical world, not just online. Walking around San Francisco, you're surrounded by billboards, street posters, and ads from companies like Uber, Notion, Tesla, and Vercel. Start taking photos and studying what catches your eye and why.

Several street-level examples were analyzed:

- **A therapy flyer** that failed: black and white, visually busy with no clear focal point, no explicit value proposition, and a design that felt "spammy" given the seriousness of what it was selling. Marketing is a combination of design and writing — this one needed visual hierarchy and clearer messaging.
- **A watercolor class poster** that succeeded: it looked like a book cover (familiar, unexpected format for a poster), had a clear brand voice ("chill and wholesome"), and was visually distinctive enough that multiple people in the room had noticed it walking past. One person took a photo — "I count that as I clicked it."
- **A Vercel billboard** saying "npx v0" — instantly compelling to developers because it's a command they can run. Targeted, specific, no wasted words. A later version changed the copy to "What would you ship?" which was seen as weaker — the original was better because it was an action, not a question.

The lesson: simplicity works when you have brand recognition. Without it, you need to do more work to earn attention. But in all cases, visual hierarchy and clear messaging are non-negotiable.

## Student Work Critique

The lecture closed with live review of student projects:

**Product demo video (Kleros, a product search alternative to Amazon):** The video opened by asking "If you want to play like Roger [Federer]" and then spent 30-40 seconds showing an Amazon search before getting to the actual product. The feedback: get to the value proposition immediately. The first seconds should hook, and this video buried the lead. The tennis framing also narrowed the audience unnecessarily — if the core value is "find better products than Amazon," lead with that universal frustration. Additional issues: mixed landscape/portrait format, low visual contrast making the screen hard to read, and pacing that was too slow for TikTok. The suggestion: use humor to broaden appeal (everyone has bad Amazon search experiences), and invest five minutes in making it visually presentable.

**SaaS launch tweet (Superdash, AI-generated dashboards):** The copy was too long for the Twitter scroll environment. The advice: "Work with an eraser" — cut ruthlessly until it's scannable. "Introducing AI generated dashboards on Superdash" could simply be "Generate AI dashboards on Superdash." Every unnecessary word reduces the chance someone reads it while scrolling.

**Spine of the Week — Statville:** The standout share of the week. Statville is an Instagram account where every new follower causes the city (rendered in Blender) to grow by one building. Followers vote on what gets built next (Ferris wheel, ski resort) via stories. Spin-off accounts like "the Statville supermarket" emerged organically, posting daily content like banana sales. The account grew by 80,000 followers in a month. This was highlighted as a masterclass in designing shareability and community engagement — followers aren't passive; they're citizens who shape the world they're in.
