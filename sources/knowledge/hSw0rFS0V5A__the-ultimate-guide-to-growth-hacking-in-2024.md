# The Ultimate Guide to Growth Hacking

Growth hacking, stripped to its essence, is running marketing experiments to acquire new users and retain existing ones. It's a "whatever it takes" mentality — some tactics are non-traditional, some are traditional, but the defining characteristic is speed. You form a hypothesis, execute the experiment as fast as possible, and arrive at a decision: double down or kill it. No experiment should stretch into a multi-week expedition. Two to three days is the target window.

The critical mindset shift: getting the word out is just as important as building the thing. Builders — coders, musicians, creators — have a chronic tendency to keep adding features, tweaking tracks, polishing content, and never actually marketing. The site codingweekmarketingweek.com exists literally to alternate your focus: one week you build, one week you market. Be hyper-cognizant of this balance.

## The AARRR Funnel

The pirate metrics framework — Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Referral, Revenue — is a foundational lens for thinking about growth. Each stage is a lever you can optimize independently.

**Acquisition** is how people find you in the first place. For software, that might be Twitter/X, SEO, ads, Reddit, or Product Hunt. For music, it's Spotify, SoundCloud, YouTube. For content creators, it's TikTok, Instagram, YouTube Shorts. The question is simply: where are new eyeballs coming from?

**Activation** is the "oh shit" moment — how quickly does someone go from discovering you to realizing they need what you have? It's the moment a user thinks "oh shit, I need this product," or a listener hears a track and thinks "oh shit, what a banger." The faster you can engineer that moment, the better your funnel performs.

**Retention** is whether people come back. This can happen through push mechanisms (notifications, emails, viral stunts that re-engage users) or pull mechanisms (built-in habits where users seek you out on their own, like checking TikTok from 9 to 10 every night). Push is when you distribute to the consumer — a new email, a notification. Pull is when the consumer comes to you organically.

**Referral** is whether users tell others. This manifests as word of mouth ("bro, you've got to check out this tool I'm using"), social sharing (5,400 people sharing a Buildspace video), or structured referral programs. When someone in your community brings a friend to your next event or shares your content, that's the referral engine working.

**Revenue** (or your North Star metric) is the business outcome you're tracking. For some, this is literal revenue from day one — affiliate income, subscription payments. For others, it's users, subscribers, watch time, or listeners. The specific metric matters less than the fact that you're tracking one obsessively.

Studying this funnel forces clarity on two fronts: it surfaces which specific experiments you should run next, and it helps you articulate what problem you're actually solving.

## Clarifying Your Problem: The Time or Money Model

A deceptively simple framework for articulating the problem you solve: does your product help people save time, save money, or both — directly or indirectly?

The Uber vs. Lyft thought experiment illustrates this. Given two rides to the same destination — Uber at $44.95 arriving in 2 minutes, Lyft at $35.24 arriving in 8 minutes — different people make different choices depending on whether they value time or money more in that moment. There's rarely a meaningful third axis for most products.

Applied examples from the cohort:

- **JotBot** (AI essay writing): saves time directly — you have an hour before your essay is due, AI writes it in your voice. Time savings is so acute that price sensitivity disappears. Add a referral mechanic ("share with 5 friends, get 5 months free") and now you're also helping users save money, which drives the referral part of the funnel.
- **Bloq** (distraction blocker): saves time directly — one tap disables distracting apps.
- **Claros** (AI product recommendations): saves time by replacing hours of Reddit scrolling with instant product recommendations. Adding price comparison across Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy would layer on direct money savings — doing both is powerful.
- **James's YouTube channel** (coding tutorials): "Make software development fast and fun." A one-hour Airbnb clone tutorial saves time directly. It saves money indirectly by replacing a paid course or hired developer. And it helps users make money indirectly if they use the knowledge to build and ship their own products.

The model works for the vast majority of products, though it's less intuitive for entertainment and content. For those cases, the transformation model (below) often works better. But even in content, time plays a role — the observation that shorter song intros and one-minute tracks tend to perform better is itself a time-savings insight.

For products where the time/money model doesn't map neatly — luxury goods, status items — the indirect effects matter. A Rolex or Supreme hoodie doesn't save time or money directly. But wearing it can help you close deals (making money indirectly through status signaling). The example of a mentor who bought a custom Porsche in the early 2000s because in automotive business dealings, having the most impressive car was literally what closed deals — the car was a money-making tool disguised as a purchase.

## The Transformation Model

Everyone is selling a transformation at some level. The job is to make that transformation super obvious in everything you put out — videos, ads, landing pages, bios, stories.

The pattern is: your audience feels a certain way (the "before" state), and your product/content takes them somewhere better (the "after" state).

Taylor Swift is the canonical example. Her fans believe "she's writing songs for me." The transformation she sells is taking someone from "no one understands how I'm feeling" to feeling deeply heard and understood. Every true fan feels personally spoken to.

The Samsung vs. Apple camera comparison makes this concrete. Samsung advertised "108 megapixels" — a spec that tells you nothing about whether your photos will actually look better. Apple's "Shot on iPhone" campaign just shows breathtaking photos taken by real people. Viewers immediately feel "I could take pictures like that." The transformation (trash photos → stunning photos) is self-evident. No specs needed.

This applies to content creators especially. When an audience connects with a creator's work and finally feels heard or represented, that's the transformation at work.

## The Buildspace Houses: An Extended Growth Experiment

A detailed case study of how a growth experiment evolves from quick test to long-term community asset.

The problem: Buildspace had a large Discord community during Nights & Weekends Season 1. People were having conversations and having fun, but there was no deeper sense of belonging — no mechanism to make people feel part of something larger that felt like home.

The inspiration came from the British school house system — Sapphire, Ruby, Emerald, Topaz — where house identity created fierce loyalty and emotional investment. "Even today, if someone asks, I'm like, no bro, I'm not fucking Ruby. I'm Sapphire."

The experiment execution was fast. Four landing pages whipped up in Framer, each with AI-generated imagery (using Stable Diffusion, learned just a week prior) and different fonts. Showed them to a small group to gauge reaction. People immediately started self-identifying — "I'm the yellow one, I'm the blue one" — without even knowing the names. The initial experiment confirmed the concept had emotional pull.

From there, breadcrumbs were seeded gradually. Season 2 assets included subtle house codes (S001, A001) in editing frames that went out on social media. The houses were never formally announced at that stage — just quietly tested to see which ones people gravitated toward and how the aesthetic would look on Twitter. Only later were the four houses (Specter, Alteroc, Godmars, Airwolf) officially introduced with dedicated sites.

The lesson: start with a fast, cheap test. Read the signal. Double down incrementally. Let it marinate.

## Naveed and Unriddle: A Growth Hacking Case Study

Naveed, an SF1 Buildspace student, was building Unriddle — an AI tool for interacting with documents and research. He entered the program at $2K MRR.

A few weeks in, he went on an intense growth experiment blitz, running every tactic he could think of in rapid succession:

- Created specific landing pages for different user archetypes (biologists, PhD researchers, students, parents)
- Scraped public researcher datasets to collect emails and ran outbound email campaigns
- Reached out to influencers
- Ran paid ads on Reddit
- Set up affiliate marketing
- Recorded product demos and launched them on X/Twitter
- Paid people to post in student Discord servers
- Sent direct emails

Most experiments took two to three days max. He ran them until he found the one that worked: influencer marketing on TikTok. He paid five influencers between $50 and $200 per video. One of those videos blew up to 600,000 views and doubled his MRR from $2,000 to $4,000 over a single weekend.

"Everyone's looking for a silver bullet. It simply does not exist. You just have to try a bunch of shit."

## Compounding Funnel Optimizations

A worked example showing how sequential experiments compound through the AARRR funnel.

Starting state for a hypothetical research AI tool with a free tier and $10/month pro plan:
- 10,000 site visitors
- 1,000 account signups (10% conversion)
- 50 paid users (5% conversion from signups)
- $500 MRR

**Experiment 1 — Top of funnel (acquisition):** A TikTok influencer video blows up, driving site visitors from 10,000 to 50,000. With all other conversion rates unchanged, MRR jumps from $500 to $2,500. One experiment, 5x revenue.

**Experiment 2 — Signup conversion (activation):** A/B test the landing page to double the signup rate from 10% to 20%. Now 10,000 people create accounts instead of 5,000. MRR goes to $5,000.

**Experiment 3 — Pricing (revenue):** Add a $3/month mini plan below the $10 pro plan. 20% of free users convert to the mini plan. This captures revenue from users who would never pay $10 but will pay $3, adding another layer of MRR.

**Experiment 4 — SEO and referrals (acquisition + referral):** Build long-term organic funnels to sustain 100,000+ consistent monthly visitors.

The key principle: change one variable per experiment so you can attribute results clearly. Study your data obsessively between experiments. Before running the next experiment, make sure you have the infrastructure to actually collect and learn from the data it generates.

## Time Management: Parkinson's Law Meets Pareto's Principle

**Parkinson's Law:** Work expands to fill the time allocated for its completion. Give your landing page redesign two weeks and it will take two weeks, even though you could ship something adequate in two days. Give a YouTube short the whole day and it takes the whole day; give it two hours and you'll be surprised what you produce.

**Pareto's Principle (80/20 rule):** 20% of your task list determines 80% of the project's outcomes. Identify the 20% that matters most and execute on that.

The power move is combining both: instead of spending two weeks on a landing page, give yourself two days. Focus on the 20% of elements that drive 80% of the impact. Ship the 80%-done version in two days and spend the remaining twelve days collecting data, learning from real user behavior, and making informed improvements — rather than polishing in a vacuum.

Applied to content creation: instead of spending 12 hours on one perfect short, create three 4-hour time blocks and ship two shorts by hour eight. Now you have two pieces of content collecting data you can learn from, instead of one piece that's marginally more polished.

## Keep It Simple

Everything — your messaging, your landing pages, your marketing — should be understandable at a glance. The anti-pattern is the "Nolan mental model": Christopher Nolan's film *Tenet* is beautiful but almost nobody understood it. Don't be Tenet. Be obvious.

A TikTok example drives this home: a video of someone simply flipping through a book called "Don't Believe Everything You Think" with the caption "this book will save you years of emotional suffering in less than 100 pages" — no complex pitch, no elaborate explanation. The video hit 155 million views, 155K likes, 45K bookmarks, and 1,400 shares. Viewers could buy the book directly through TikTok Shop.

This kind of non-traditional, native-to-platform marketing is why teenagers with zero marketing education are outperforming traditionally trained marketers. They have no legacy frameworks to unlearn. They just try things, keep it simple, and move fast.

"You're too smart for your own good. Just try a bunch of shit, give it two to three days, and see how it can help you. Make a decision fast."
