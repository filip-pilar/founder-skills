# Become a Master at Focusing Like Kobe and Christopher Nolan

This lecture dismantles the popular narrative that greatness comes from being locked in all the time. The core thesis is that focus actually comes in two distinct types — relentless execution toward a clear goal, and deliberate, structured play — and that the people we admire most for their focus are actually cycling between both. The mistake most builders make is either grinding nonstop on a single goal until they burn out, or exploring aimlessly without any structure. The skill is learning to alternate between the two modes intentionally.

## The Illusion of Permanent Focus

The lecture opens with Christopher Nolan as the primary example. Actors describe working with him in almost surreal terms: "There's nothing to be hamletary about Chris. Everything is very British and very calm. There's no chaos." On set, Nolan appears to have all the answers. He's directing hundreds of people spending millions of dollars per week, and he can't afford a single unfocused hour, let alone an unfocused day. From the outside, he looks like a man possessed — someone operating at a level of focus that feels unreachable.

But this is only the visible part. What we don't see is the four years Nolan spent working on the Oppenheimer script on and off. We don't see him and Hans Zimmer in the studio months before the script was even finalized, experimenting with sounds and ideas for what the film could feel like. We don't see the years he spent playing with IMAX cameras starting with Batman Begins in 2005, long before IMAX became his signature. By the time Nolan arrives on set for those three focused months of production, he has already thought through everything hundreds of times. The calm isn't supernatural discipline — it's the result of years of exploration that made the execution feel like routine.

Kobe Bryant follows the same pattern. During games, he was locked in — pulling off plays that looked impossible, never second-guessing himself across four twelve-minute quarters. But what people don't see is him shooting hundreds of practice shots after a game he lost, practicing very specific types of shots, not random ones. "Even the way he's practicing is actually pretty focused." The game-time performance was built on a foundation of deeply intentional practice.

The same applies to Steve Jobs and the iPhone. The finished product looks like the result of singular, relentless focus. But there's an entire book written about just the iPhone keyboard, and the team started working on it in 2003 — four years before the iPhone shipped. "You all see the final end-focused product, but we don't see all that time spent playing almost."

The point is not that these people weren't focused. They were extraordinarily focused. But their focus wasn't a single unbroken state. It cycled between deep exploration and intense execution.

## Two Types of Focus

The lecture introduces a simple framework: there are two types of focus, and you need both.

**Type One** is the version most people recognize. You are locked in on a very clear milestone — a numerical target, a ship date, a specific outcome. You believe in it fully, you're not questioning it, and you're going hard. This is Nolan on set. Kobe in the fourth quarter. A founder grinding toward a launch. The goal is hyper-clear and you're relentless in pursuing it.

**Type Two** is focus on playing, training, and testing your limits. It's Kobe practicing layups after a loss. It's improving your writing. Trying a new camera. Playing with a new AI library. These activities keep your mind fresh and give you new capabilities so that when game time arrives, you're not scrambling to figure things out — you just show up ready. "When you actually need to show up, you have all of that stuff kind of ready to go, such that when you just show up, you're not thinking about messing around, you're just showing up."

## The Danger of Over-Indexing on Either Type

Both types of focus become destructive when taken to extremes without the other.

**Over-indexing on Type One** looks like a founder spending months grinding toward $1,000 in monthly revenue, never stopping to question whether that goal even matters anymore, and spiraling into burnout. "You essentially get burned out just trying to pursue the goal. But then you don't ask yourself if that goal is even important anymore." When you're locked into a Type One goal, you have to be fully bought in — you need genuine belief in and patience with the goal. Without that buy-in, relentless execution just becomes suffering.

**Over-indexing on Type Two** looks like exploring ten or twenty different things and ending up confused by the end. Making a new product every week. Messing around with a new program every week. "That sounds really hard. So it's like even making that your focus is like maybe not the best idea, even if you are confused." Unstructured exploration is just as exhausting as unquestioned grinding — it just feels different.

Both paths lead to burnout. The answer is balancing them.

## On-Season and Off-Season

The practical application of this framework at buildspace was structuring work into explicit on-seasons and off-seasons.

**The on-season** was Nights and Weekends — a six-week program that the team ran four times. During those six weeks, the team operated like athletes in a season. Every day was clear. They knew what had to be done because it was planned ahead of time. The set of possible actions on any given day was small and obvious: send that email, do a livestream, make that tweet, create a highlight video, lock down the venue. "Prioritization happens when you have too much to do and you don't know what to choose from. In this case, there was kind of a very clear set of things to do and you just did them."

What made it work:

- **The goal was singular and clear.** They wanted a thousand new ideas created during Nights and Weekends. They set this months before starting and never questioned it. "If we hit that number, we'd be good."
- **They agreed on what was not important.** When someone suggested taking lectures, polishing them, making thumbnails, and putting them on YouTube, the answer was: "We already have recordings. YouTube already records, so just send in the link. Why are we out here spending so much time polishing the videos?" Little decisions like these were made beforehand, eliminating distraction during execution.
- **They only did things they were already good at.** On-season was not the time to learn TikTok or experiment with new formats. They stuck to what they could execute at their best.
- **They never questioned what they were working on.** For six weeks straight, there was no "damn, should we be doing this?" They just ran. "We didn't think about it at all."
- **External accountability created a lock-in mechanism.** With 18,000 people signed up, canceling would mean wasting people's money and time. The structure made it impossible to turn the car around, which was done intentionally. "We actually did this on purpose because I felt like as a team, we had to kind of lock in. And so we made this system to help us lock in."

The result was that the team — six people — reached a collective flow state. Not just individuals in flow, but the work itself reaching a flow state. Reflecting on it afterward, both the speaker and long-tenured team members who had 20 years of working experience agreed it was the most focused period of their entire careers.

**The off-season** was the time between seasons — sometimes as short as two weeks, sometimes as long as six months. This was explicitly structured time for reflection, play, and testing limits. No pressure to deliver on something particular. No need to show your best. "We just had to show up and explore something new, that's it."

The critical insight is that even during the off-season, there is still structure. The team sets clear two-week goals — Type One goals that guide the play so it doesn't become aimless wandering. For example, one two-week cycle's goals were: hit 500K accounts on Instagram, 50K views on YouTube, and ship a web demo of the product. These goals don't represent a grand vision to be relentless about. They're guardrails for exploration. "These are still pretty light goals actually, but they're still kind of concise and clear. They're like Type One goals. But this isn't what I wake up in the morning to go after. They're more just guiding my play time."

Every two weeks, the team meets (Sundays) and asks: what are we doing for the next 14 days? That's all the planning needed. The off-season goals change every two weeks, and that's by design — they're meant to help discover what the right goals actually are. Over time, during the off-season, you naturally get a little more focused and play around a little less each day, getting closer to the feeling of being ready to enter the next on-season. "Put me in coach."

## It's Unrealistic to Be On All the Time

A recurring theme is that hustle culture's expectation of permanent intensity is not just unhealthy but counterproductive. "I think it's unrealistic to be on all the time. Because my feeling is that you have emotions and you have limits that you don't even know yet and you'll probably break down." It would be absurd to expect Kobe to play like it's the fourth quarter every single day, even during practice. The same applies to builders.

Even within a company, being "on" all the time doesn't work. Apple releases the iPhone, then chills, then makes the iPhone 2. Every real company has on-seasons and off-seasons, even if they don't name them that.

The speaker is candid about his own relationship with this: he sees a consumer product opportunity that could reach billions of people in the next decade. The vision is hyper-clear. But he knows that if he goes relentless right now, he'll have an emotional breakdown in six months and shut everything down. "I already know myself. So what's the point? I'd rather take it my way." The six-month off-season is a deliberate investment in building the team, the skills (particularly in AI), and the personal readiness to sustain twelve months of relentless execution when the time comes.

## Patience in a Plan vs. Just Waiting

There is an important distinction between patience and waiting. Patience means you've done something and you're awaiting the result — the work is in motion and the outcome takes time to manifest. Waiting means you're sitting around hoping something will happen to you. "A lot of people end up in that scenario where they're just waiting for magic to magically happen to them. But it's not gonna happen."

During Nights and Weekends, patience looked like committing to the plan and trusting it would work without questioning the GPS at every exit. The program's structure made patience easier because changing course had real consequences — people had booked flights, spent money, committed time. "You're not allowed to change. You have to actually sit in the box and then just get good at being in the box." This constraint was engineered on purpose. The result was "beautiful sprints of focus because all of a sudden you're not questioning the plan. It's almost like you're assembling an IKEA desk. You don't question the plan when you're assembling an IKEA desk."

That said, sticking to the plan doesn't mean rigidity on every detail. Two days before season four launched, they cut guest speakers entirely. The core plan stayed the same — the season still happened, the structure held — but tactical adjustments were always allowed.

## Knowing When to Switch Modes

The lecture addresses the hardest practical question: how do you know when to stop exploring and start executing, or vice versa?

For switching from exploration to execution, the signal is feeling genuinely ready and excited about a specific goal. "I'll stop exploring once I feel like, yo, I'm really good at my craft. Like I'm good enough to actually be the best in the world at this now, if I'm just relentless for 12 months." The analogy is a UFC fighter who trains for six months for one specific fight — they know exactly what they're being relentless for.

For switching from execution to exploration, the signal is when the goal stops exciting you. "For me it's like when the goal doesn't excite me. A million downloads doesn't really excite me, a million users doesn't really excite me. So I gotta find some time to figure out what does excite me."

There's no universal formula. Different people will have different answers, and that's correct. The speaker acknowledges that someone else might look at his six-month off-season and say "what the fuck, just be relentless, just go after it right now." The key is self-knowledge: understanding your own limits, motivations, and what actually sustains your best work over time.

## Deadlines and Public Accountability

Deadlines function as a forcing mechanism for focus. The speaker describes himself as "classically kind of lazy" but reliable when a deadline exists. The buildspace team uses deadlines constantly — even in the off-season, there's a Friday deadline for a demo. During Nights and Weekends, the entire structure was built around immovable deadlines: marketing starts, season starts, IRL events happen. "BuildSpace without deadlines — I know what happens. We just do a lot of stuff and mess around but nothing actually gets out."

Public accountability amplifies this. Announcing a date publicly — like the 2/4 livestream that was chosen simply because "2/4/24 looked cool as a date" — creates a commitment that's embarrassing to break. "The moment I press this button, everybody's gonna know that we're doing something on 2/4. And if we don't, we're gonna publicly embarrass ourselves." Whether this is healthy is debatable, but it works.

## The Company as a Separate Entity

A subtle but useful reframe throughout the lecture is thinking of yourself as both the company and its employee, even if you're a solo builder. Does your company give you time to play? Does it make you show up like a madman every day? Is it fun to work at your company, even if you're the only employee?

This separation creates useful distance. Instead of "I should grind harder," the question becomes "Is Superdash treating Matija well?" or "Does Samia Records give Samia time to chill?" The speaker's own approach: "My job is just to make the company a really great place to work. And I think if I do that, I'll also do really good work."
