# 5 Mental Models to Improve Your Designs

This lecture shifts from the concrete design principles covered in earlier sessions (the CHATS framework) to the mental models that sit underneath good creative work. The speaker (Stamon) presents these as thinking tools — "don't fall in love with the tool. Would you fall in love with a fucking pencil? No, right? It's the same thing." The session weaves between teaching models, live-reviewing participants' shipped work, and two new mental models the speaker is presenting for the first time.

## Know Who You're Building For

The most fundamental mental model: everything you design, write, or build is shaped by who it's for. The speaker illustrates this with a side-by-side comparison of Netflix and a Chinese video streaming app. Netflix is immediately recognizable — clean, minimal, designed for a very defined audience. The Chinese app looks chaotic to a North American eye: live comments, share-to-earn mechanics, prices on individual features, the ability to buy Dolby Atmos for a single video for pennies, screenshot and GIF-recording tools baked into the interface.

But none of that is bad design — it's design for a different audience. Chinese users are deeply accustomed to microtransactions. You can read 70% of a book for free, then pay per thousand words in fractions of a cent. That infrastructure exists in China because the banking systems support sub-penny transactions; the U.S. doesn't have that yet. The design serves the audience it was built for.

The principle extends beyond product design to personal brand and content. The speaker recalls a creator he was incubating who would sell Pantene ads one day and promote a competing product the next. "Your audience is losing trust in you because every day you're pushing a new product." Consistency matters because audiences can smell inauthenticity — and the simplest fix is just being authentic.

Knowing your audience also means defining it with increasing precision over time. The speaker references a question from the previous session: "Is my audience Indians? Is my audience Indian Americans? Is my audience third-culture kids?" These are different audiences with different needs, and the answer sharpens with each iteration.

## Don't Aim for Perfection, Aim for Iteration

The speaker tells the story of a university photography class (possibly Stanford — he doesn't recall exactly). The professor split the class into two groups. One group had to produce a single incredible photograph over the entire semester to earn an A. The other group simply had to take 100 photos over 100 days — regardless of quality, they'd get an A. The group that took 100 photos produced far better work. They got better by putting in the reps.

This model recurs throughout the session. One participant admits he wrote a long-form post a month ago but kept procrastinating, trying to edit it down and perfect it, before finally just posting it. The speaker's response: "Beautiful, yeah." Just ship it. The iteration is the teacher.

## Live Reviews: Applying the Models

The lecture includes live reviews of three participants' shipped work, each demonstrating the mental models in practice.

### The Long-Form Post (Designed to Be Bookmarked)

A participant shared a long, knowledge-dense post. The speaker's reaction: "I didn't read a fucking word. But I bookmarked it." And that was the point. The post was designed — whether intentionally or not — to trigger bookmarking as the primary user action. The speaker and his collaborator Jeff used to deliberately engineer this: certain posts are "for bookmarking." They'd get 20–30 likes but hundreds of bookmarks. "It's all by design." When you create a post packed with free value and free information, the natural user response is to save it. That post did its job.

### The Landing Page (Clarity Over Cleverness)

A participant showed a landing page for a physical NFC device. The feedback from both the speaker and other participants: it felt unbalanced, with the pre-order button misplaced relative to the left-aligned text. But the deeper issue was clarity. The original had a tagline like "designed against addiction," which the speaker called out as meaningless — "which doesn't mean anything. And you're like, what is that?"

The speaker redesigned it in two minutes to demonstrate the fix: strip it to the essentials. What is it? An NFC device that lets you block any distractions with a tap. How many are there? A hundred units. When does it ship? March. That's it. "I did it in two minutes, so excuse my typo there, but it's an NFC device that lets you block any distractions." The audience is transacting their time with you — "you're asking them to give 15, 30 seconds of their life. For what in return?" Being explicit about the value proposition takes you far.

### The No-Code Podcast (Distribution as the Unlock)

A participant shared a podcast where he interviews people building with no-code tools, with live demos as the centerpiece. The speaker's reaction was genuinely enthusiastic — "I fucking love this, dude. I really did. I saved it to a playlist." He called it an extremely high-value video for people trying to ship with no-code.

The feedback focused entirely on distribution, not content quality. The content was already strong. The missing piece was a compelling thumbnail (the current starting image didn't hook), a better title, and — crucially — cross-posting. The video targets a high-intent audience (people searching for Bubble apps on YouTube), so the content-audience fit is there. The question is just funneling them in. YouTube search is one door — but Reddit, Hacker News, Bubble forums, low-code/no-code communities are all additional doors that cost almost nothing to open.

This review leads directly into the next mental model.

## The Variable Lottery Tickets Mental Model

This is one of two new mental models the speaker introduces for the first time in this lecture. The setup: imagine a one-billion-dollar Powerball. Option one is a single ticket for $2. Option two is eight tickets for $5. Nearly everyone in the room picks option two — three extra dollars for 8x the chances.

The internet is that giant Powerball. Every time you post something, you're buying a lottery ticket. If you've already made a YouTube video — that's your $2 ticket. But for three extra dollars of effort (cross-posting to Reddit, Hacker News, forums, cutting clips for TikTok and Instagram), you can get 10 more tickets.

"You've already done the work, bro. You've already made the video, posted it on YouTube, you'll fix the thumbnail, adjust the title. So now it's like, let's get as many different — you have built this house, let's create more doors for people to come in."

The downside is zero — "the worst case is no one walks in through that door, which would be the same as if you never posted." The upside is asymmetric. One tweet can blow up and send a thousand people to your video. "Don't rob yourself of that."

Practical applications the speaker mentions: cross-post written content to relevant forums and communities. Cut the best parts of a podcast into short-form clips for TikTok, Instagram Reels. Share on niche communities where your audience already lives. Each additional post is another lottery ticket that costs almost nothing relative to the original creation effort. The speaker himself has gone from seeing a podcast clip on TikTok to exiting the app, going to YouTube, and watching the full episode — that journey happens all the time.

## The Baby Bolt Mental Model

The second new mental model, still being refined (the speaker notes the name may change). The framing: is a baby Usain Bolt?

Most people in the room are like a baby learning to walk. They've mastered crawling and they see everyone around them walking and running. They get up, take their first steps, and fall. A baby in that moment doesn't think "everyone around me is walking and running, I'll never catch up." But imagine if a baby had full context on Usain Bolt — knew about the 9.58-second 100-meter record, understood the gap between where they are and where the best in the world is. That baby would take ten times longer to get their first step.

"You see how crazy that sounds, but you see how all of you guys do that."

The room has full context on greatness — Jobs, Gates, Swift, Drake, whoever their idols are. They know what it takes to be great, all the good and bad. And that context, paradoxically, paralyzes them. Knowing the destination makes the first step feel impossibly small and inadequate.

The antidote: stop comparing. Don't care if people laugh when you fall. Get back up, take more steps, lean on the people around you for support, and string those first few steps together. "For now, just go and take your first few steps. Stop overthinking. A baby is not Bolt."

## Q&A Highlights

**On balancing consistency with iteration:** The speaker deliberately placed consistency last in his framework (from the previous lecture) because you have to go through many iterations before you find something that works. In the beginning, it's very exploratory — you experiment with content types, formats, and styles. Once you find what works, then you optimize for consistency and production. This applies to every element: landing pages, content formats, personal brand.

**On auditing your creative process:** You audit by doing. The first thing you learn from actually shipping is how long things take. If three videos take three days, the question becomes: can I get it under a day? What do I need to introduce in my workflow? When shifting mediums (e.g., from Twitter writing to short-form video), start with tools you already know — CapCut, iMovie, whatever — post the work, look at feedback, and refine the process from there. The reps reveal the inefficiencies.

**On naming and branding decisions:** A participant was stuck choosing between an imaginative brand name and a descriptive one. The speaker's advice: "How long have you spent on it? Fifteen minutes? Just pick one and go for it." His personal technique is to take a few candidate names to bed and wake up with clarity. Pick something where the domain and handles are available, then commit. "You can always rename. Facebook became Meta after God knows how long."
