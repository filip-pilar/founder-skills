# The 3 Things It Takes to Be a Writer

This is a short lecture on what good writing actually is and how to approach it. The central framework: good writing must be **clear**, **meaningful**, and **persuasive** — the writing equivalent of good design being usable, useful, and beautiful. The session also hammers one crucial process point: always work backwards from intent. The lecture uses live examples — a book cover, a crypto tweet, a cold email, and buildspace's own internal drafting process — to illustrate each idea.

## Writing Is More Than Words on a Page

The lecture opens with a reframe. Writing isn't just text — it's the most powerful way to shape the world. Buildspace itself was built primarily through words: words in emails, words in tweets, words in videos. When you write, "you're literally inviting people into your mind, your stories, and your view of the world."

This matters because even people who don't think of themselves as writers are creators at heart. If you're building something — a product, a brand, a company — you are already a writer whether you've claimed that identity or not.

## The "I'm Glad My Mom Died" Exercise

To demonstrate that writing is inseparable from its visual context, the lecture shows the sentence "I'm glad my mom died" in isolation and asks the room what they feel. The responses range from "psychopath" to "resilience" to genuine sadness.

Then the book cover is revealed — Jennette McCurdy's memoir, with its bright colors and comedic tone. The same sentence transforms entirely. What felt dark or disturbing now reads as funny, or at least deliberately provocative. The book is actually a comedy about her relationship with her mother, though the underlying story is sad.

The takeaway: "Don't ever separate visuals from writing. It's part of a greater whole." Color palette, typography, imagery — these aren't decoration layered on top of writing. They're part of writing itself.

## The Three Qualities of Good Writing

The lecture presents a direct parallel to the design framework from an earlier session (where good design was defined as usable, useful, and beautiful). Good writing needs to be:

### Clear

If people don't understand what you're trying to say, they won't care. The worst outcome isn't rejection — it's indifference. "The worst case scenario is that you put something out into the world, people can't even say yes, and they can't even say no. So they just scroll right past."

The example: a crypto/Web3 tweet from a large account that's nearly impossible to parse on a quick scan. Nobody can tell what it's about, so nobody engages. Crypto and Web3 content is cited as a reliable source of bad writing examples. The lesson is simple — you need people to understand you before anything else matters.

### Meaningful

Writing must communicate something of value. That value takes many forms depending on what you're building: saving time or money (for SaaS products), providing interesting information, or making people laugh. Laughter is singled out as "the pinnacle" of offering value because "laughter can transcend many things."

### Persuasive

Connecting back to the marketing lecture, all writing ultimately wants the reader to take some action — buy something, sign up, or adopt your point of view. Persuasion includes convincing someone that your offering has value, or that your worldview is the right one. Buildspace's own 2424 livestream is cited as an example: they spent significant time persuading the audience to see education differently.

## The Cold Email That Demonstrates All Three

The lecture breaks down a well-known cold email sent to Sean Perry (who was hiring for Milk Road). The email reads:

"Hey Sean, I made an irreversible decision. Just 30 days in, I quit [some job]. The opportunity cost of not being full-time in crypto was too high. Lucky for you, this means that I'm on the market. I think you should hire me."

Then it closes: "I got two ideas, one for Milk Road, one for MFM. Want to hear them?"

This email nails all three qualities. **Clear**: you immediately understand what this person wants — a job. The key points are bolded so Sean doesn't even have to read the full text. **Meaningful**: it's directly relevant to Sean's hiring need. **Persuasive**: the closing is a frictionless yes-or-no — "want to hear them?" makes the reader's decision easy. No long pitch, just a door to walk through.

## Work Backwards from Intent

The most important starting point for any piece of writing is figuring out what you actually want to say. This sounds obvious but is where most people get stuck. "What do you want to say to people? I think that's actually a really difficult thing."

The advice is to approach this iteratively: "Keep shooting and figure out your target." You need to keep posting and writing because that's the only way to get feedback on whether you've found the right message — or even the right topic. Writing regularly, even outside your product work, is strongly recommended. The entire buildspace team writes about all sorts of things to help them clarify what they're building.

## Buildspace's Own Drafting Process

The lecture pulls back the curtain on how buildspace communicates with its audience, using their month-long "off-grid" period as a case study. They had to craft a message telling their community: (1) they're doing something different this year, (2) the mission hasn't changed — "build a world where anyone with an idea can turn it into reality," and (3) address specific audience segments with their questions (like S4 graduates wondering about S5).

The message went through six to ten drafts. Titles alone cycled through versions like "We shut down our company for a month" and "I became a monk for a month." One version was a more personal Farza founder story, opening with startup cliches — "Steve Jobs finding himself in India while doing LSD, Phil Knight traveling the world before coming up with Nike" — before pivoting to what buildspace was actually doing. All versions tied back to the same intent, but found different angles.

Even the internal process of deciding what to build next was treated as a writing problem. Ideas were jammed on, then distilled into a pitch deck — not for investors, but for themselves. The forcing function: "Anytime we're coming up with something new, we immediately think about how will we communicate this to our audience?"

## Planning Emotional Arcs

The lecture briefly reveals a more advanced layer of writing craft: mapping the emotional journey of the audience. For buildspace's one-hour livestream, they mapped out when the audience would be happy, when they'd dip (finding out S5 was delayed — "they're going to be sad as fuck"), and how to bring them back up. They planned how to communicate the delay, knowing they needed to earn the audience's understanding.

This kind of emotional architecture — thinking about the reader or viewer's experience across time — is presented as part of "working backwards from intent." The intent isn't just the message; it's the feeling you want the audience to walk away with.

## The Core Principle

Working backwards from intent is "probably one of the most important things — that's going to start to make everything else really easy." But the lecture is honest that figuring out your intent is the hard part. The process is messy, iterative, and requires writing through the confusion rather than waiting for clarity to arrive.
