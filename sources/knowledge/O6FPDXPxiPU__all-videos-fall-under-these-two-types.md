# All Videos Fall Under These Two Types

Every video you could make — and every video you see — falls into one of two categories: **timeless** or **memes**. Understanding the distinction helps you decide what to create and why.

## Timeless Videos

Timeless videos are built around a feeling. They transcend the moment they were made in and keep pulling people back years, even decades later.

The first example is a Casey Neistat video posted 12 years ago — low production, probably shot on a small camera, but saturated with storytelling and emotion. It conveys a feeling so effectively that people keep returning to it. A comment posted a year ago reads: "This never gets old. For the last 10 years I keep re-watching every now and then." That's the mark of timeless content — it doesn't decay.

The second example is a creator named Natalie, whose work is newer but carries the same quality. A commenter wrote: "I'm so late to your story. I've just come across you yesterday on Thanksgiving but I'll say I'm thankful I did. I watched every video on your channel oldest to newest and I'm glad I did. Felt like I was on this journey through life with you, living through your eyes, your travels and experiences." This is what timeless videos do — they create a feeling so strong that someone will binge an entire channel and feel like they lived alongside the creator.

The key characteristics: timeless videos don't need high production value. They need storytelling, emotional resonance, and a feeling that transcends any particular moment in culture. They're the videos you return to when you're lost or looking for inspiration. Casey Neistat's video is the speaker's go-to when trying to figure out how to make a great video — it provides a framework through feeling, not instruction.

## Memes

Memes are videos tied to a generational time period — a current trend, a template, a cultural moment. They work differently from timeless content but serve their own important purpose.

The audience's responses reveal why meme-format videos work:

- **Familiarity breeds willingness.** When you recognize a template, you're willing to watch more because you already know roughly what you're going to get. The format lowers the barrier to engagement.
- **Urgency to participate.** When everyone is doing a trend, there's social pressure and excitement around joining in. The audience admitted they'd tried recreating the meme templates shown.
- **Familiar but not too familiar.** The sweet spot is content that's recognizable enough to feel comfortable but different enough to hold attention. When something is completely new, there's more cognitive load — more things to understand before you can enjoy it.
- **Execution matters within the template.** Everyone might be doing the same trend, but "people who executed it well, it was like, great." The template is the entry point; the execution is the differentiator.

## Both Serve a Purpose

Memes are not lesser than timeless videos. They both serve a purpose — they're both trying to communicate something. Memes are a very effective way to get a message across quickly, whether in a humorous or serious way. The question isn't which type is better, but which type fits the context of what you're trying to say and who you're trying to reach.
