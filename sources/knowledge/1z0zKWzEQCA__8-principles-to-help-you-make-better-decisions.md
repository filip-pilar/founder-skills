# 8 Principles to Help You Make Better Decisions

## The Core Premise: Judgment Is Everything

The single most important thing separating builders from their goals is the quality of their decisions. Not effort, not knowledge, not connections — decisions. And the engine behind good decisions is judgment.

Decision-making follows a simple three-step process: gather data, apply judgment, then decide. Or put plainly: read the menu, see what sounds good, order it. The critical step — where most energy should go — is the middle one. Judgment is the lens through which you see data in order to make decisions.

This is why some CEOs get paid millions to work less hard than early-stage founders. They're paid for sound judgment — the ability to make good decisions on behalf of many people. Same with top artists: they get paid to make what they think people want. "Good judgment is the most valuable trait in the world."

In the early days of building, the actual decisions matter less than most people think. Instagram or TikTok? B2B or B2C? Spend $100 on an influencer post? The answer is usually just pick one, because the main thing when starting out is to take action and gain momentum, not to make perfect decisions. If you agonize over trivial early-stage choices, your decision-making process needs work. If you pick quickly because you recognize it doesn't matter much yet — your process is likely sound. What matters at every stage is the internal process you use to decide, and that process needs sharpening over your entire life.

## Principle 1: When the Long-Term Is Unclear, Make Good Short-Term Decisions

When you don't know where things are going, there's always something you can do that will be helpful no matter where the path leads.

**Declan and Derek** were building an AI study app that got off to a strong start — $20-25K in early revenue. But they didn't know where the company was heading over the next year, so every daily decision felt paralyzing. The advice: do whatever improves your numbers now. No matter what you decide later — whether you sell the business, pivot, or keep running it — better numbers will only help. Short-term thinking applied correctly is never a bad idea.

**Adam** asked whether he should focus on making content or find a tech pivot and raise money. Either path requires traction. So the short-term answer: focus on getting traction the best way you know how, and come back to the bigger strategic question later.

**Buildspace itself** faced this when the Dubai government offered millions over three years to run a campus. Most people would reflexively say yes — it was something they had actively pursued. But the team turned it down. The reasoning: buildspace had pivoted dramatically multiple times over three years, and that pattern would likely continue. Committing to something nearly as long as the company had existed was the wrong long-term bet, even though it looked like success in the short term. The lesson cuts both ways — something that feels like a win can still be the wrong decision.

## Principle 2: Quickly Weigh Potential Upside Versus Downside

This resembles pros and cons analysis but with an important distinction: pros and cons feel concrete and definitive, while upside/downside thinking acknowledges uncertainty. You're estimating best-case and worst-case scenarios, not cataloging facts.

**Kat** was asked to DJ a party for Brian Johnson but was worried — she wasn't confident in her DJing ability yet and feared embarrassing buildspace. The quick analysis: upside includes pushing her comfort zone, networking, getting feedback on her work, and discovering whether she likes DJing in person. Downside is potential embarrassment. After weighing those, the answer was clear: go for it. Sometimes people just need a small confidence push after the analysis confirms the upside dominates. The group also noted that we are our own harshest critics — the things we fear will be embarrassing rarely register with others.

**Kareem** had a working food truck catering business but was considering pivoting to selling foot traffic data. Big decision. Upside of the pivot: larger market, better margins, already somewhat validated, and renewed excitement. Downside: unfamiliar territory. Despite being a significant decision, the upside/downside framing made it surprisingly clear — the pivot was worth pursuing. When someone has a seemingly obvious preference, it's still worth running through the analysis to confirm it, but the exercise often reveals that even big decisions can become straightforward.

## Principle 3: If Your Decision Is Emotional, Don't Pretend It's Logical

Many builders rationalize emotional decisions with logical-sounding justifications. Common version: "I need to make a bold move to progress — now is the time." The reality might be that the grind is boring and impatience is driving the urge to change.

This happens constantly. People consider monetizing their audience, raising money, or selling their business, and frame it as strategic necessity when it's really restlessness. The principle isn't that emotional decisions are wrong — it's that you must know why you're making them. If you make an emotional decision and it works, great — impatience served you. If it fails, at least you know it was impatience that led you astray, not some flaw in your strategy. Either way, you learn something true about your decision-making.

The speaker described experiencing this repeatedly over 20 years of entrepreneurship — asking "should I keep pushing or quit and try something better?" The rationalization: "I'm not progressing, I have to change." The reality, many times: just needing a two-day break, after which everything felt fine again. Self-awareness about what's actually driving a decision is the meta-skill underneath all the other principles.

For significant decisions, take more time and be more skeptical of the impulse. For smaller ones, going with your gut is fine. And if the same decision keeps resurfacing after breaks, it's probably a real pattern that needs addressing, not just a mood.

## Principle 4: When in Doubt, Do the Math

When you're unsure whether something is worth pursuing, put actual numbers to it. Make a spreadsheet. Enter how many people you think would want the product, how much they'd pay, what it costs to deliver, how many you can realistically serve in a given timeframe. Even if the numbers are rough, the exercise forces objectivity and can quickly reveal whether you're looking at a $50K idea or a $10M idea.

Buildspace does this constantly — they've modeled roughly 100 business ideas by running quick math on each. Should they sell merch? They know how much they can sell, the margins, the delivery logistics, and the staffing needs. Five to ten minutes per idea is enough to get a useful signal.

**Mihir and Kiran**, building a B2B cloud management tool, discovered a possible new opportunity through their exploration. Rather than deliberating abstractly about whether to pursue it, the advice was: make a spreadsheet, run the numbers, see what it looks like.

**Ryan** was building a clothing brand, had made $1K net, and wanted to reach $4K in a month. The math reframes the problem immediately: at $25 per shirt, he needs to sell 160 shirts. At $500 per leather jacket, he needs to sell 8. Factor in production time, audience size, growth capacity, and unit economics — the jacket path suddenly looks far more realistic than grinding out shirt volume. The math doesn't just validate; it redirects.

The time-boxing dimension matters too: how many hours do you have? Can you make a jacket in 5 hours or 40? You set the parameters — time, price, capacity — and work backwards. Even if the projections aren't guaranteed, at least the math checks out on whether the goal is even theoretically reachable.

## Principle 5: Doing More Than One Thing at a Time Will Likely Result in Failure

Making music while making a film. Selling while trying to raise money. Making content while monetizing it. Building a business while becoming an artist. These pairs each contain two genuinely hard things, and attempting both simultaneously means neither gets the full energy and conviction it requires.

The caveat: if you already have momentum and a team, maybe you can juggle. But even at buildspace, with resources and experience, they try to avoid splitting focus.

The deeper issue is that attempting two things at once often masks indecisiveness. "Should I make music or make a film? I'll just do both" might really mean you can't pick one or lack conviction. Forcing yourself to choose — if you had to pick one, what would it be? — at least reveals which thing actually matters to you.

There's a distinction between truly splitting focus and using one discipline as creative recovery for another. One cohort member described working on a song, hitting a wall, then switching to scriptwriting for a few days before returning to the song with renewed inspiration. That's not really doing two things at once — it's a focused way of working that uses a secondary project as a productive break. The key question: is the other activity serving the primary work, or competing with it?

Building a startup and building an audience for that startup aren't two separate things — they're both part of the same goal. The principle applies when you're genuinely trying to advance two separate, significant endeavors simultaneously. "Doing one of these things is hard enough, and you need every advantage you can possibly get."

## Principle 6: Time Is a Currency — Treat It as an Investment

You can spend 60 hours of work time per week in countless ways: building, launching, selling, networking, eating, napping, procrastinating. You can drill further — 30 hours on one core feature versus splitting 15 hours on an extra feature and 15 on bug fixes. Each allocation produces outputs roughly proportional to the time invested.

Before attempting anything, consider the time cost. If it takes a small amount of time, the decision is easy. If it will significantly impact your trajectory, the time investment is precious and deserves careful thought. One cohort member who had worked as a contractor found this intuitive: when you bill hourly, an hour literally equals money, making it easy to see waste. "Time is equal to one, basically."

An important nuance emerged from discussion: the value of time isn't uniform. Energy levels fluctuate — one hour of peak focus is worth far more than one hour of depleted effort. And context matters: one hour spent listening to a valuable lecture might be worth more than one hour of solo work, depending on the moment. The practical implication is to think about both how you spend your time and how you maximize the value of the time you spend.

At the most disciplined end, even five-minute increments matter. This level of time-consciousness tends to increase naturally as you get busier — scarcity sharpens awareness.

## Principle 7: Assign Probabilities to Better Weigh Decisions

You can't just look at potential outcomes — you have to weigh the probability of those outcomes actually happening.

The framework in concrete terms: working a job for 40 hours a week gives you roughly 100% odds of making $100K in a year (salaried). Painting art for 60 hours a week might give you 50% odds of making $30K. Building an AI startup for 80 hours a week might give you 10% odds of making $10M in five years. These probabilities completely change how you evaluate the options.

This is how sales pipelines work: a 10% chance of closing a $100K deal is worth $10K in forecast revenue. An 80% chance of closing a $20K deal is worth $16K — actually more valuable despite the smaller headline number. Probability-weighted thinking becomes second nature in sales and should be applied to all major decisions.

The probabilities are admittedly guesswork, but they serve two purposes. First, they impose a frame of objectivity on chaotic, emotional decisions. Second, they create a useful data point even if imperfect. Once you've decided to pursue something — say, a career as an artist — probability thinking shifts from "should I do this?" to "how can I increase my odds?" Whether that means producing more work, collaborating more, or changing distribution strategy, you're now working to improve the probability rather than debating the path.

A practical simplification: think in orders of magnitude. Is this a $100K market or a $10M market? You don't need precision — rough orders of magnitude are enough to compare opportunities meaningfully.

## Principle 8: You'll Never Know What Was Good or Bad Until Much Later

A good short-term result can come from a bad long-term decision. A bad short-term result can come from a good long-term decision. This is simply the reality of operating under uncertainty.

Leaving a job is a clear example: in the short term, your income drops to zero — looks terrible. In the long run, it might be the best decision you ever made. Or it might not. Three years might pass before you know. And even then, the counterfactual — what would have happened if you'd stayed — is unknowable.

The implication isn't paralysis or nihilism. It's that all you can do is apply the best principles and tools available, take your best informed guess, and then be honest with yourself about why you made the choice. The honesty matters because it's what lets you learn and improve your judgment over time. If something succeeds and you know it was luck (high risk, unlikely to work, yet it went well), you won't over-index on that approach next time. If you're not honest about the luck, you'll expect the same outcome again and be caught off guard when probability catches up.

## On Feedback and Asking for Help

A relevant tangent from the Q&A: the value of feedback isn't about the volume of opinions you collect but what you do with them. The Neil Gaiman quote captures it precisely: "When people tell you something is wrong, they're almost always right. When they tell you exactly what's wrong, they're almost always wrong." There's almost no harm in asking for feedback — the only cost is time.

When in crisis, one cohort member shared a useful approach: don't reach out immediately while over-saturated and unable to articulate the problem clearly. Process it first, gain some clarity, then bring it to someone else. You'll waste less of their time and they'll be better positioned to help. That said, going to someone immediately isn't wrong either — it's about knowing your own pattern.

## On Rest and Disconnecting

The question of when to stop working has no formula, but physical separation helps. Leaving your laptop at the workspace so you literally cannot work at home. Being in nature, where technology and business feel disconnected by default. The key is to segregate — create environments where work is simply not an option, rather than relying on willpower to stop.

## On Luck

Luck plays a huge role, but there's no point trying to account for it in your decision framework. Pursue the highest-probability path and if luck lands on your side, great. If it doesn't, you weren't counting on it. The critical thing is being honest when something was lucky — when you took a high-risk, low-probability bet and it happened to work. If you mistake luck for skill, you'll repeat the approach expecting the same result, and probability will eventually correct itself.
