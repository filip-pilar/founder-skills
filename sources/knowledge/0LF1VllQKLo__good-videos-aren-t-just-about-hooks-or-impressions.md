# Good Videos Aren't Just About Hooks or Impressions

The question "what makes a good video?" doesn't have a single answer. Story, cinematography, curiosity gaps, engagement — they all matter. But before any of that, before techniques and formulas, the foundation is something simpler and harder to teach: feeling.

## The Four Fundamentals

A good video comes down to four building blocks:

1. **Storytelling** — the types of storytelling you can do across platforms (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, blogs), which vary by format and audience.
2. **Basic techniques** — the craft elements that support the story.
3. **Workflow** — the process of going from idea to finished video. What are the building blocks? How do you get from a concept to a format?
4. **Feeling** — the emotional core that ties everything together.

## Start With Feeling, Not Formula

When you're starting out, making videos should be driven by feeling — not by optimizing hooks, structuring CTAs, or chasing impressions. The speaker's own origin story illustrates this: as a kid, he recorded Counter-Strike Source gameplay using Hypercam, slapped good music behind it, and posted it. There was no thought about intros or endings or retention curves. The only question was: *does this feel good to me?*

That instinct matters more than technique in the beginning. This is especially relevant for builders who aren't trying to become professional video creators — they just want to show what they're working on and tell people about their product. If you're not deep into the craft of video production, don't worry about intricate details. Make it feel good to you first.

## Videos Are Emotional Vehicles

Videos make us laugh, cry, feel motivated, and take action. After watching a movie or a video, you feel some type of way — hype, amused, inspired, moved. That emotional response is the real product. The technical elements (hooks, content structure, calls to action) are just delivery mechanisms for that feeling.

## Make Something You'd Actually Watch

The most basic and most overlooked test: **would you want to watch this?** When there's pressure to ship content — deadlines looming, a countdown running — people scramble to get videos out that check all the boxes but miss the fundamental question. Are you making this because you genuinely find it interesting, or just to post something and show the world what you're doing?

"If you don't like it, then others won't either."

Don't focus on chasing numbers. Focus on chasing something you actually like watching. The numbers question comes later. The taste question comes first.

## The Core Point

"Good videos ain't just about good hooks, content, and a CTA." The formula matters, but it's not the foundation. The foundation is making something that carries a feeling — something you'd watch yourself, something that moves people. Everything else is technique layered on top of that.
