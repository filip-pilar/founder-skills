# Instantly Improve Your Writing

This is a short, focused session on a single principle: writing gets better when you remove things. Jeff calls it "write with an eraser." The lecture walks through a live editing exercise on a real job application, then examines two examples of concise writing that hit hard — a Sticker Mule email and a viral Twitter thread. The throughline is that most people's instinct is to add more, when the move that actually improves their writing is to subtract.

## Write With an Eraser

The core idea is that making writing good and clear is usually a matter of cutting, not adding. Most first drafts have extraneous content — filler words, unnecessary qualifiers, context that doesn't earn its place. The path to stronger writing runs through deletion.

This connects to Charlie Munger's principle of inversion. Munger, Warren Buffett's long-time partner, argues that when you want to achieve something, instead of listing everything you need to do, figure out what you need to stop doing. If you want to write better, the most productive move is often identifying and eliminating the things that weaken your writing — not piling on new techniques.

## Live Exercise: Erasing a Job Application

Jeff shows a real application they received from someone applying for a video producer role at buildspace. The application isn't terrible — the person clearly has experience — but it reads like a first draft. It's long, uses generic language, and doesn't earn the reader's attention.

The exercise is simple: the audience calls out what to erase. Words like "diverse" get cut. Whole sections get flagged for deletion. The audience turns out to be harsher critics than Jeff — some suggest starting over entirely.

The point isn't cruelty. It's that once you start erasing, the writing immediately gets better. Removal is the first and most powerful editing tool.

## Jeff's Rewrite

Jeff then shows his own version of the same application, written in a buildspace voice. The rewrite demonstrates several principles beyond just brevity:

**Open with specificity and context.** The rewrite starts: "Damn, I really like the content Bill Smith is putting out there, it's a really fresh take on what education is." This immediately signals that the applicant has actually studied what buildspace does — not just sent a generic application.

**List credentials, then undercut them.** The rewrite lists experience — startups, traditional broadcast TV, media, ads, livestream — then immediately follows with "none of that matters." This is a deliberate structural move. Jeff explains: "I'm showing that I already have all these experience. By setting it a different way, I'm saying that all of this experience, actually, I'm willing to learn what you guys do." The list proves competence; the dismissal proves alignment with buildspace's ethos of doing something genuinely new.

**Make the ask frictionless.** Instead of long paragraphs about qualifications, the rewrite says: "Check out three things I made in the past I'm proud of and I think you'll like too. Hit me up for a chat." This turns the decision into a quick yes or quick no based on the linked work. The writing gets out of the way and lets the portfolio speak.

**Show you've done your homework.** The rewrite closes by referencing buildspace's YouTube specifically and suggesting improvements. This signals that the applicant isn't just interested in the company abstractly — they've looked at the actual output and have opinions about how to make it better.

The meta-lesson: the rewrite is dramatically shorter than the original, but it communicates more. Every sentence does real work.

## Example: Sticker Mule's Email

Jeff shows an email ad from Anthony, co-founder of Sticker Mule:

> "Tape is half off today, I'm listening. Get 100 feet of custom tape for only $9. Normally $19 for the free ship. P.S. New Joe Tomorrow."

Jeff's reaction: "This is sick." Anthony could have written a thousand-word email. Instead, the message is a few lines that hit hard. The casualness ("I'm listening"), the specificity ($9, normally $19, 100 feet), and the brevity all work together. There's nothing to cut because there's nothing unnecessary.

## Example: The $4,000 Business Thread

Jeff highlights a Twitter thread that opens: "Three months ago, I bought a business making $500 per month for $4,000 on Acquire.com. It's now worth $100K and made $4,000 last month."

Two sentences. Almost everyone in the room is immediately interested in the how. The opening works because it's concrete (specific dollar amounts, specific timeframe, specific platform) and creates an instant curiosity gap — the transformation from $500/month to $100K in value demands explanation.

Jeff also points to the line "Disclaimer: please try this at home" as a trust signal. It tells the reader this is going to be practical and reproducible, not a flex. Combined with the thread format — "I know that when I click in, it's gonna give me little chunks of stuff that just makes me happy when I read it" — the whole package is engineered for readability.

## The Underlying Principle

All three examples — the rewritten application, the Sticker Mule email, the Twitter thread — share the same DNA. They're short. They're specific. Every sentence does work. Nothing is there for decoration or to sound impressive. The writing serves the reader, not the writer's ego.

The lecture's implicit argument is that most people write too much because they're afraid of leaving something out. The counterintuitive move is that leaving things out is exactly what makes the remaining words land harder.
