# Design 0→1 in 10 Minutes

## The Holy Trinity of Design

Every design — whether it's a product, a website, a video, an outfit, or a piece of music — must satisfy three qualities, in strict order of priority:

1. **Useful** — It solves a real problem or meets a genuine need for the user.
2. **Usable** — A person can interact with it without significant effort or confusion.
3. **Beautiful** — It's aesthetically pleasing and enjoyable to experience.

These three form what Stavan calls "the holy trinity of design." All three matter, but the weighting is not equal. Usefulness is the foundation. If something isn't useful, it doesn't matter how usable or beautiful it is. This hierarchy is non-negotiable: "Please start there. Do not start here [at beautiful]. Starting here is no different than the shitshow we see on Dribbble." Prioritizing aesthetics over usefulness is, in his words, "no different than just being a snake oil salesman."

### Usefulness First

The starting question is always: what problem does this solve? What need does this meet for the end user? This connects directly to whatever you're building — your product, your content, your art. If the foundation isn't useful, nothing else you layer on top will save it.

A practical example: if you put out a video that looks visually stunning but nobody engages with it, that's a signal that it wasn't useful enough. There weren't enough insights for the viewer to walk away with. Analytics don't lie — people churn when they don't find value.

### Usability Second

Once usefulness is established, make it easy to interact with. "They're not here to solve a fucking puzzle or mystery. They just want to use it." The user found something useful — don't make them work hard to figure out how to engage with it. If it's difficult to use, they'll simply leave.

This principle applies far beyond screens. Usability matters in music, film, fashion, art — every domain. Think about how usability applies to your specific medium.

### Beauty Third (But Don't Skip It)

Finally, make it aesthetically pleasing. Everyone intuitively knows what good design looks like. But the critical caveat: in your effort to make something beautiful, never sacrifice usability or usefulness.

When asked whether beauty happens naturally once the first two are nailed, Stavan's answer is nuanced. In the pursuit of making something useful and usable, ideas for the aesthetic dimension naturally emerge — a musician crafting a beat already starts picturing the music video. But he warns: "Do not rob yourself of this process." Don't skip ahead. Let each stage inform the next.

## The Design Process: Start Scrappy, Get Feedback Fast

### Don't Obsess Over Tools

A major trap Stavan sees repeatedly: people spend days or weeks evaluating tools instead of doing the work. "Do not wait six days evaluating the best fucking framework. Should I use Premiere Pro or DaVinci Resolve? Like stop." The tool doesn't matter nearly as much as starting.

If someone asks whether they should switch to Framer, his response is: what do you use now? If learning Framer takes two months plus two weeks to implement, that's ten weeks where you could have been collecting feedback instead. "It's okay if that place is Canva. It's okay if that place is CapCut." Start with what you know.

### Pen and Paper → Low-Fidelity → Ship

Stavan walks through his own process using a real example — designing the next chapter of Buildspace while in Mexico City about 18 months prior:

**Step 1: Pen and paper.** Right after a brainstorming session, within 15 minutes, he sketched out the concept on paper. Then immediately showed it to his team for feedback. He could have spent two or three days in Figma instead, but that would have been wasted time.

**Step 2: Excalidraw.** After getting initial feedback on the paper sketch, the next step wasn't Figma — it was Excalidraw, a lightweight canvas tool that feels like pen and paper but allows roughing out flows and wireframes. User flows, page structures, interaction patterns — all mapped out at low fidelity. This addressed the usefulness and usability layers: how does the user move through the experience?

**Step 3: Ship it.** The team built and shipped the actual product — user profiles, company profiles, the full experience — in two weeks. Not after perfecting every interaction in Figma, but by getting it live. "This idea flopped, don't get me wrong, it was trash. But hey, we legit shipped it in a span of two weeks versus spending all this time making it pretty."

The lesson: they learned far more by shipping fast and iterating than they would have by polishing in isolation.

### Share Early, Bring People Along

Stavan identifies a common fear: people are afraid to share work-in-progress because they want others to see the finished vision. This is a mistake on two levels.

First, you rob yourself of early feedback that could save weeks of wasted effort. Second, you rob your audience of the journey. "They're following you for the journey, not the destination." He compares it to a film — showing only the final five minutes where the hero sails into the sunset misses the entire story. The audience wants to see the ups and downs.

When you overcomplicate the process — waiting for perfection before sharing — "you create these unscalable mountains in your head." The buildspace philosophy, reflected in their logo, is about breaking those mountains into achievable steps.

### The Mistake He Made (So You Don't Have To)

Stavan admits he made this exact mistake throughout his teens and early twenties — spending too long perfecting before shipping or sharing. The entire framework he presents is born from that experience. The urgency in his delivery is genuine: he's watched cohort after cohort at buildspace fall into the same trap, and the cost is always the same — lost time and lost feedback cycles.
