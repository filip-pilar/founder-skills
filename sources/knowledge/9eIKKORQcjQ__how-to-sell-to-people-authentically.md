# How to Sell to People Authentically

## The Car Salesman Who Never Sold Anything

Farza's father came to America from Pakistan in the early 1990s. He drove taxis, flipped pizzas, and eventually landed a job selling cars at a Nissan dealership in Miami in the late '90s. Over 25 years later, he works at one of the highest-performing dealerships in the country and consistently ranks number one in his region by performance percentage.

Growing up, Farza spent years sitting in the corner of his dad's office at a Toyota dealership, doing homework while overhearing customer conversations. What he observed shaped his entire understanding of selling: his dad never tried to sell anything. He never pushed a product, never pitched an upgrade, never played the salesman role. Instead, he just tried to understand the person sitting in front of him. After 10 or 20 minutes of genuine conversation, he'd make an offer — something he felt would be good for the customer and also work for him. That was the whole method.

By contrast, the other salespeople at the dealership operated like walking advertisements. They'd deliver scripted pitches: "We have a package that gives you leather seats for just $1,000 more — are you interested?" or "The new 2010 Camry is the best car in its class, and you should have this car." The replies were always the same — awkward deflections, polite declines, people looking for the exit. "It almost felt like these salespeople were delivering an IRL ad, like in person. Like they were literally an ad, but as a human being."

The core insight: Farza's dad succeeded not by being persuasive, but by being genuinely curious about people. He'd learn about their family, their life, their situation — and only then, if it made sense, he'd suggest the blind spot detector to the parent who seemed protective of their teenager. The sale emerged naturally from understanding, not from a pitch.

## You Have a Selling Problem

Farza presented data from the most recent exam day at BuildSpace SF2: 15 projects were flat or down, 11 were only slightly up (often from a last-minute push that didn't reflect sustained effort), and only about 2 showed a genuine, intentional leap. Roughly 50% of the cohort made zero movement in a week.

The diagnosis wasn't effort — everyone was clearly working hard. The problem was selling. "SF2 has a selling problem. They don't have a problem of not putting in the work."

A common excuse: "What I've got right now is kind of crappy and unfinished. It's not there yet." Farza's response was blunt — that will always be the answer. "I think a lot of people think Facebook as a company is still crappy and unfinished." The feeling that something isn't ready never goes away. So the question becomes: what do you do despite that feeling?

Every person in the room already had something — a thing they could describe, show, and demonstrate. The path forward was twofold: improve your craft, and sell. But selling doesn't mean pretending you have a Mercedes when you have a 1996 Honda Civic. "Your goal is not to pretend like you sell a Mercedes. It's to find the people that are down to rock the 96 Civic that you have." Pretending to sell something polished when your product is early-stage is exhausting and dishonest. Finding people who are genuinely interested in where you're headed is the real work.

Farza also argued that everyone already had the core skills of selling: the ability to talk about what they're working on, the ability to show a demo, and the ability to have a normal conversation and take feedback without imploding. "This is actually everything you need to sell."

## Strategy 1: Stop Marketing, Start Selling

This was framed as the single most important takeaway from the lecture.

**Marketing** is building an audience for your work — creating a mass of people who you encourage to buy, support, or engage with what you're doing. Think Apple campaigns, Nike ads. **Selling** is getting someone to actually take the action you want them to take at the end of the funnel: a follow, a listen, a purchase, an account creation, active usage. The distinction matters enormously at the early stage.

The word "selling" here doesn't strictly mean exchanging goods for money. It means "the ability to get someone else to take an action that you want them to take."

### The Funnel Math That Destroys You

Most people in the cohort were running a marketing funnel: post something (email, Reddit post, TikTok, Reel, tweet) → hope people click through to a landing page or link tree → hope they click a CTA → hope they complete the action (sign up, buy, subscribe). That's four steps, and the conversion math is brutal.

Industry-average numbers for this kind of flow:

- 100% see the post
- 10% click through to the landing page
- 1% click the actual CTA
- 0.5% complete the final action

In real numbers: 100 people see your tweet, 10 click the link, 1 clicks the CTA, and 0.5 complete the action — which rounds to zero people. "A lot of you send 100 people to your stuff and then nothing happens and you're like, wow, nothing happened. Why? Well, it's because the math is against you."

Even at 1,000 people in the door, you end up with roughly 5 who complete the action. The math is simply brutal for anyone without massive reach.

### Go Straight to the Five People

The alternative: if your goal is to get five people to take action, why not go directly to those five people instead of pushing 1,000 through a leaky funnel?

**BuildSpace's own origin story** illustrates this. When they were starting, Farza wasn't making TikToks or running ads. They discovered that their first users were coming from college CS Discord groups. So they leaned into that — creating college-themed landing pages for individual universities and building relationships with Discord moderators. They eventually had relationships with over 100 moderators, and each CS Discord group gave them an average of 35 users. One hundred Discord groups yielded 3,500 sign-ups. "Still a hard game to play actually, but that's how we got 3,500 people to first sign up for what we were doing."

This was 90% more targeted than making a YouTube video or a reel. They went straight to where their people already were.

### Concrete Examples from the Cohort

**Daniel (The Block — a focus device):** Daniel's instinct was to start making content. Farza pushed back: is content the most efficient way to sell more blocks? The group brainstormed alternatives that went straight to buyers: sell to coworking spaces (call 10 and get them to buy 5 blocks each for their offices), sell to schools (teachers spending $10 of their own money to help students focus in class), sell to hacker houses, go to retail stores that stock similar products, sell to small companies wanting their workers more focused. "You don't actually have to make a bunch of videos... You can actually just make a call and just sell like 10 tomorrow."

**Brayden (Chesskey — a chess learning tool):** Instead of posting on Reddit and Product Hunt and hoping people trickle through, go to chess clubs, chess tournaments, chess club Discords. Someone suggested paying chess streamers — $100 for a streamer who averages 1,000 viewers to use Chesskey for 20 minutes. "Doesn't sound that crazy. Worth a shot."

### Choosing Activities Wisely

When brainstorming these direct selling approaches, prioritize high-value, low-effort activities. Going to a two-day chess tournament sounds exciting but might be a massive time sink compared to getting into five chess club Discords in an hour. "It's your responsibility as the builder to not get sucked into stuff that's gonna sound really cool and could work, but then doesn't." Test ideas fast and cheap before committing significant time.

These targeted strategies will eventually stop working — BuildSpace ran out of interesting college Discord groups eventually. "But until it breaks, keep doing it. And then you gotta discover other stuff."

## Strategy 2: Have One-on-One Conversations

The underappreciated superpower of being small is that you can give people your one-on-one time. Large companies can't do this. You can.

People won't engage with your early-stage product because the product is amazing — it's a 1996 Honda Civic, remember. They'll engage because they enjoy the conversation with you. Because you're interesting. Because you're telling them "this Honda Civic is gonna be sick in like two months" and they want to come along for the ride. "Your actual power is that you're an individual and you're someone who cares about what you're working on. You're not just another NPC that's trying to sell something on the TikTok shop."

### The Lucy Moore Story

Farza's first customer at ZipHomeschool was a woman named Lucy Moore from Texas or Georgia with a young daughter. At that point, Farza had no curriculum — no math exercises, no reading exercises, nothing. Building that takes years of expertise. But he had himself.

Every Monday, he'd have a 30-minute one-on-one call with Lucy. She'd tell him what her daughter was struggling with. He'd spend the week learning how to make good exercises for that specific child. Every Friday, he'd deliver a Google doc with personalized reading and math exercises.

"This is stuff that a big company can't do." He was competing not on product quality but on personal attention and responsiveness. The first few weeks were rough, but by week eight, they had a rhythm. Eventually he hired someone to handle it. But that initial one-on-one relationship — built on a promise and delivered through genuine care — was the foundation.

### The Right Balance

On these one-on-one interactions, your goal is not to sell them anything, and your goal also isn't to become their best friend. It's somewhere in the middle, and it's a hard line to walk. If you come in selling hard, they'll feel it immediately — "fuck, this guy's just trying to upsell me." But you can't become everyone's friend either.

What you do on these calls, emails, and in-person conversations: you learn. Learn about their life, their existence, their situation. Then at the end, present a solution if you have one. Just like Farza's dad at the dealership.

### The Party Mental Model

Imagine greeting someone at the door of a party — waving, giving them a high five, welcoming them in with genuine warmth. Now imagine the alternative: they arrive at the door and see "scan the QR code," then "go to the back," then "pay me," then "authenticate with Google." Instead of all that, just greet them at the door. "Why are you making your life so hard?"

### Conversation vs. Networking

This is explicitly not networking. "Networking is making fake friends and connections to move yourself forward for your own purely selfish reasons." Conversation is just getting to know each other. There's a real difference.

### Applied to Specific Projects

**Anish and Amara (AI shopping assistant):** Instead of expecting people to go through a robotic sign-up flow, what if they created a Calendly link: "Book a time with us and we will help you buy your camera, right on the call." A human shopping assistant using the tool in the background. The person gets what they want (help buying a camera), and the product gets real usage and validation.

**Diabetes tracker team:** Instead of a landing page with "$20/month, personal diabetes assistant," what about booking one-on-one calls with people who have diabetes and showing them the tool directly? "If they just do 30 of those in a day, how many of those at the end will want to buy this?" For someone managing a serious condition, a personal demo is far more compelling than another automated flow.

**Nyati (content creator):** With viewers already engaging with the work, what would it take to have 20 minutes with one of them? Not to sell, but to learn from them, let them experience what you're building. "I wish I could still have one-on-one conversations with everyone who comes through BuildSpace. That'd be amazing. But I can't. So you should do this while you can, because it's really fun."

### The Convoke Story

Farza's third favorite artist of all time is a rapper named Convoke. They met randomly at a video game tournament. Convoke hugged him, asked what his favorite song was, and spent a full hour just hanging out and talking. That was four or five years ago. "To this day, every time he drops a video, a tweet, an Instagram story, I don't care what he drops, I'm like on it." Not because Convoke was trying to make a fan — "I think he was just being himself." One genuine hour of personal attention created a permanent supporter. That's the power of one-on-one.

## Strategy 3: Pick the Easiest Person to Sell To

The BuildSpace origin story has a painful chapter. In 2018, Farza and Alec built a cloud IDE for college students — a tool that eliminated the painful first week of CS courses spent on environment setup. They built it in two weeks. Then they tried to sell it to schools.

Universities take six to twelve months to sign a contract. They spent three months on this before giving up. Then they pivoted to selling directly to students. The problem: students have no money.

"We picked the hardest people in the world to sell to. Schools and students." In retrospect it's obvious, but in the moment they were too deep in it to see it. They wish they'd sold to an easier customer — tutors teaching 12-year-olds to program, for example, where the sale goes through the parent.

The lesson: you choose who you sell to, and you can always adjust to make it easier for yourself. This doesn't mean making wild pivots — going from developers one week to basketball players the next. It means small, deliberate experiments around the edges of your target audience.

**Ryan (clothing):** Selling individual clothing items to random people on the street is hard — they need to discover it, like it, have it fit properly. Farza had run a clothing company before and found it faster to sell in bulk to companies: 50 of the same hat, 50 of the same shirt. That might not work for everyone, but it's an example of adjusting who you sell to.

**Abel (medical student tool):** Selling to medical students sounds hard. After spending many weeks on that segment with limited progress, it might be worth trying an adjacent audience rather than grinding against the same resistance.

**Bonnie (gift product):** Her plan to approach gift shops was solid, but the advice was to stay flexible. If no gift shop replies, don't get married to that specific segment — find someone who requires less push to get through the door.

## The Takeaway

Don't be the scripted car salesman delivering an in-person ad. When you end a reel with "go to my link" or close a tweet with "check out my thing," that's exactly what you look like.

Social media posting is playing a free lottery — keep doing it, play every day. "But don't let that be your strategy. That's not a strategy to sell." Real selling at the early stage is direct, one-on-one, and targeted.

Keep making content, keep posting — but understand that's marketing, not selling. Your actual selling strategy should involve going directly to where your people are, having genuine conversations, and finding the people who require the least push to say yes.

And above all, focus on inputs over outputs. You can't control whether your graph goes up. You can control what you put into the game. "It's very easy to get caught up in the idea that you're flatline or you're going down or you're flopping. I don't know. It's just one graph. There's many graphs that we could look at."
