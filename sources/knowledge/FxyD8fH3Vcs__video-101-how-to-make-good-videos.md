# Video 101: How to Make Good Videos

The speaker has been making videos since childhood — started around eight or nine years old after seeing his sister make YouTube videos, grabbed a camera, and thought he could do something better. From there it was music videos, weddings, corporate videos, small client work, and eventually Buildspace. That trajectory matters because the core message of this lecture is that video-making is a craft you develop through feel and repetition, not through mastering rules upfront.

## Start with a Feeling

When you're starting out, a good video should just be a feeling. Before hooks, before CTAs, before any framework — it should feel good to you. The speaker's first videos were Hypercam recordings of Counter-Strike Source gameplay with music slapped behind them. He wasn't thinking about intros or endings. He just wanted to make something that felt right.

This is especially important for builders who aren't deep into video production and just want to show what they're working on. If you're not experienced with intricate video craft, don't worry about it yet. Just make something that feels good to you. The most basic gut check: is this a video you would actually want to watch? If you're making it just to post it, just to show the world you're doing something, people will feel that. "If you don't like it, then others won't either."

Don't chase numbers right now. Chase making something you'd actually enjoy watching.

The deeper point: **a good video isn't just about good hooks, content, and a CTA. It's about a feeling.** Videos make us laugh, cry, feel motivated, take action. After watching a movie, you feel some type of way. That emotional residue is what makes video powerful, and it should be the starting point for everything you create.

## Two Types of Videos: Timeless and Memes

Every video you see tends to fall into one of two categories, and understanding the distinction helps you figure out what to make.

### Timeless Videos

These are videos people come back to years later. The speaker's go-to example is a Casey Neistat video posted 12 years ago — not heavily produced, probably shot on a small camera, but it has storytelling all over it. The feeling it conveys is so strong that a commenter wrote, a year ago: "This never gets old. For the last 10 years, I keep re-watching every now and then." That's the mark of a timeless video.

A more recent example is Natalie's channel (referred to as "dear strangers" content). Someone commented: "I'm so late to your story. I've just come across you yesterday on Thanksgiving but I'll say I'm thankful I did. I watched every video on your channel oldest to newest and I'm glad I did. Felt like I was on this journey through life with you, living through your eyes, your travels and experiences." That's what a timeless video does — it creates a body of work people discover and binge because the feeling compounds across videos.

### Memes (Trend-Based Videos)

Memes here doesn't just mean funny internet images. It means videos tied to a generational moment — templates, trending formats, cultural references that are alive right now. The audience identified what makes these work:

- **Familiarity**: It's a current trend, so seeing it in different forms is satisfying.
- **Urgency to participate**: Everyone was doing it, which created social pressure to join.
- **Template recognition**: "You kind of know what you're going to get" when you see the format, which lowers the barrier to watching. You're willing to watch more because the structure is familiar, but each execution is different.
- **The sweet spot**: "Familiar enough, but not too unfamiliar." When something is completely new, there's too much cognitive load.

Both types serve a purpose. Memes are a good way to get a message out quickly, sometimes humorously, sometimes seriously. Neither is better — the point is to figure out what you're trying to say and then decide which style fits that message.

### Experiment with Both

Natalie's Instagram evolution illustrates this perfectly. Early on, her feed was all over the place — around 800 followers, trying everything. Then she tried the "dear strangers" format, something that meant more to her personally. She also did template-based videos using other people's formats. Over time, as she kept experimenting, her style became more obvious and cohesive. You can literally see it when you scroll from her oldest posts to her most recent.

You should experiment with both types because you don't always know which style fits the message you're trying to convey. A skit might work for one launch video but be completely wrong for another. Don't see someone else's format and assume you need to copy the format — ask whether the *style* matches what *you* need to say.

## Steal Like an Artist

The speaker references the book *Steal Like an Artist* and says, honestly, he learned more from the cover than from reading it. The principle is direct: don't try to make an original video. Many people have already paved the way for you to make good videos — you just have to go find them.

The Buildspace example makes this concrete. The speaker was stuck — follower count was dropping, no ideas, needed to post something. So he scrolled Instagram for hours and found a video from a startup with similar vibes. He liked the hook and the simplicity. So he took the entire script framework — the context, the structure, the pacing — and mimicked it. "At the end of the day, you try to copy someone else, but you're just going to end up being you."

Think of other people's videos as templates. Even the native editing platforms on TikTok and Instagram provide literal templates — green screen overlays, trending formats. Use them. The goal isn't originality for its own sake. The goal is communicating your thing effectively, and borrowing proven structures is the fastest path there.

### Kat's Video: Mimicry in Practice

Kat needed inspiration, so the speaker asked her: what type of videos do you like watching? Who do you want to aspire to? She said Care Crafts, another social media creator. So Kat took a Care Crafts video and mimicked it — super similar structure, but at the end of the day, it was unmistakably Kat. Her own personality, her own subject matter, her own style came through.

Things that worked in Kat's video: simple word choices (echoing Jeffrey's copywriting principle of writing at a third-grade level — don't explain the theory of relativity in jargon, just tell it simply), nice pacing with music, and her own personal style layered on top of a borrowed framework. The video got about 70 views. Not viral, but a real starting point.

"This framework isn't going to work for everybody. It's not going to work all the time. But if you just keep iterating on your voice and your style, eventually you'll find something."

## Choosing the Right Music

One simple hack that everybody overlooks: choosing the right music. The speaker considers this the single most underrated element of video-making. Music guides the entire video — it shapes the pacing, the mood, and the emotional trajectory.

### Music Sets the Vibe

After watching *Oppenheimer*, the speaker came out of the theater not just thinking about the movie but thinking about all the types of videos he could make with certain parts of that soundtrack. "I look at scenes and I'm like, I can use the same song and put it on a video where I'm making mac and cheese." The point isn't that the subject matter needs to match the music's original context — it's that the *feeling* of the music can be transplanted onto anything.

A simple example: a guy just going to the movies, but with the right soundtrack, it becomes cinematic. Music transforms mundane footage into something that feels like it matters.

### Working Backwards from Music

At Buildspace, many video ideas start from music, not the other way around. Someone hears a song and says "we should make a video to this," and the team works backwards — what visuals would match this feeling? What story fits this rhythm?

The *Oppenheimer* video is a concrete example. The movie had just come out, the soundtrack was trending, and the team had watched it four times. The idea crystallized: what if Jeffrey is scrolling through a bunch of stuff and that's the moment to play the Oppenheimer music? They built the video backwards from that single musical moment — what comes before it, what comes after it. The music was the anchor; everything else was scaffolding.

### Finding Good Music

When someone asked "how do you find good music?", the answer was straightforward: you have to always be looking for it. If you listen to music — Spotify, whatever — lean into what you already like. If you like 90s rap, use a song everyone knows, like Biggie's "Juicy." When people hear a familiar song, "it just clicks" — that instant recognition creates an emotional shortcut. The same effect that works in movies (Spider-Verse used "Juicy") works in reels.

Practical advice for getting unstuck: Instagram has featured audio lists showing trending songs and how many reels have been made with each. Use those as a starting point if you can't find music on your own. But don't chase trending audio just because it's trending — it still has to fit your video. "If you're making a video about nurses helping give birth, you wouldn't use a trendy Biggie Smalls song."

Viral music can help with reach, but only if it fits the content. The answer to "does choosing music that helps with storytelling also help it go wider?" is yes — but the fit comes first.

### Matching Music to Pacing

If your video is fast-paced, choose music with faster beats — hip hop works well because the rhythms are punchy. If it's slower and more atmospheric, match that. The speaker has internalized musical rhythm from 12 years of editing — he knows beats instinctively. For people who don't have that ear yet, the advice is to listen to music more carefully, more actively. Pay attention to where beats land, where pauses happen. Text and cuts in videos often sync to musical beats, and when they do, even simple transitions feel intentional.

The Buildspace video used "Mr. Blue Skies" as its opening track — chosen specifically because it has a catchy, rhythmic intro ("dun dun dun dun dun") and was already a trending sound on Instagram. The music was picked before anything else was shot.

## The Basic Fours

Every video has four fundamental production elements: **color grade**, **sound effects**, **vocals**, and **music**.

For most people shooting on iPhones and editing in CapCut or Instagram's native tools, these elements won't be the priority — and that's fine. But they're good to know as your craft develops.

The speaker uses a Popeyes restaurant analogy to explain why these details matter. Imagine you have an amazing chicken recipe and you open a restaurant. But the space is flat — basic lighting, dull colors, functional but uninspiring tables. That's your video without production polish. Now add real lighting, richer colors, atmosphere. Suddenly people want to come in. "Now I want to go to this Popeyes." The recipe (your content) is the same, but the environment transforms the experience.

- **Color grade**: Even a slight adjustment can change a video from flat to moody, cinematic, or seasonal. Countless YouTube tutorials cover specific looks — winter moody, summer warm, etc.
- **Sound effects**: If a transition feels flat — a product reveal, a camera move — adding a whoosh or hit effect makes it dynamic. Simple additions that take seconds but change how a moment lands.
- **Vocals**: Kat's video illustrated this problem. You could barely hear her speaking, even at 200% volume. Audio quality on the voice track is a small detail that makes a huge difference. Despite this, her video still did well — which shows content matters more than production, but production compounds the effect.
- **Music**: Already covered extensively above. Music gets its own deeper treatment because "it truly helps a lot."

The key framing: "The more aware of the feelings your videos convey, the more you'll find a style that suits you." But if you're early on and just trying to make videos, don't obsess over these production details. They're auxiliary. Spend most of your time on storytelling, ideating, and having a good workflow.

## Workflow: From Idea to Posted Video

### How the Buildspace Team Works

The speaker's personal workflow for a Buildspace video:

1. **Scavenge for inspiration.** Scroll Instagram for hours. Save everything interesting to a dedicated Instagram account (his dog's account, specifically — a practical hack for not spamming the team's work Discord). Also maintains a personal Discord channel for storing raw reference material. Jeffrey sends over trending audio sounds too.

2. **Pick a song and study what others did with it.** Once a song is chosen, look at other videos using that same audio. Notice the similar vibe across different creators' versions. Follow that vibe but make it different.

3. **Write the script.** Keep it super basic. The speaker writes scripts with built-in pacing — line breaks where pauses should go. Example: "So we have all these used boxes from Amazon" — pause — next line. This prevents the delivery from being a run-on sentence and ensures natural rhythm when recording narration.

4. **Stay practical about what you can shoot.** Don't write "Bonnie's in Alaska making cardboard boxes" if you can't get to Alaska. Write around what you have and what you can film immediately.

5. **Cook up a first draft fast.** Get a rough cut together quickly so you can show it to the team and get vibes from someone else.

6. **Get feedback and iterate.** Share the draft, get reactions, make minor adjustments. But don't overthink it.

### Don't Overthink It

The speaker's closing point is a direct corrective to perfectionism. People would come to him asking what they should change about a video, and he'd think "this is already a banger — you don't have to do too much to it." The real question to ask yourself: is this video really going to move the needle for you? Is the effort of making changes worth it? Or can you just post it, show people you're building something, and move on to the next one?

"Don't think too much about it. Just shoot, go make something for yourself."
