# How to Pivot Your Ideas

This lecture reframes the concept of pivoting — typically understood as a dramatic, wholesale change of direction — into something more nuanced and useful: **calibration**. The core argument is that most builders fail not because they lack ideas, but because they either change too little (grinding away at something that isn't working) or change too much (whiplashing between wildly different directions). The skill to develop is knowing how to make the right size adjustment at the right time.

## The Cycle Most Builders Are Trapped In

There is a predictable cycle that the vast majority of makers go through. It looks like this: You have an idea. You build a first version. You show it to friends, family, people around you. They say encouraging things — "this is amazing," "you're onto something" — and you get a hit of validation you didn't even know you wanted. You feel like you're onto something real. So you keep making more of the idea. You keep going.

A month later, it starts to feel dead. The energy you had is gone, and you're chasing the feeling you had at the start. You keep adding to the idea, but another month passes and it's clearly not working. People aren't showing up anymore, but you don't understand why — after all, people *said* it was good.

At this point, you conclude you have a marketing problem. You start posting everywhere — Reddit (where you get banned from every subreddit), your dormant Facebook account from 2013, TikTok, everywhere. Spray and pray. Maybe you get 10 or 100 more people checking things out, but you're nowhere near the viral success you imagined.

Then maybe someone tells you to try short-form video. You post every day for 14 days. No views. You're not a viral success — you're just sad. You keep working on the idea for another four to six weeks before you either give up on this idea or give up on making things entirely.

This cycle then repeats. You start a new idea and run through the same sequence. It continues "until you either burn out or you run out of ideas. Usually it's A."

The two failure modes within this cycle are precise: either you do the same thing over and over making tiny adjustments that never add up to real change, or you try wildly different things so frequently that you master nothing and learn nothing from any single direction.

## Calibrating vs. Pivoting

The word "pivot" carries baggage. In the business context, it means to *completely* change direction — the key word being "completely." But what most builders actually need is not a complete change. They need to **calibrate**: to adjust based on experimental results, to take external factors into account, to allow comparison with other data.

The distinction matters because "pivot" implies a binary — you either do a massive change or you don't change at all. Calibrating opens up the full spectrum of change sizes.

A pivot is going from Zip School to BuildSpace — a complete reinvention. Calibrating is what happened across Nights and Weekends seasons one through four: specific, deliberate changes made over a year to improve the program incrementally. By season four, it was one of the best versions of the product. An example of a single calibration from S3 to S4: dropping guest lectures entirely. They felt that if guest talks disappeared, nobody would complain — and they were right.

"In reality, what is calibrating? It's actually just a bunch of mini pivots. That's all it is."

## The Neural Network Analogy

The process of calibrating works exactly like training a neural network. A neural network has a problem it wants to solve, and over time it's trained to solve that problem based on the data you give it. The loss curve starts high (very wrong) and gradually decreases (less wrong) over many steps. It never reaches zero — it's never perfectly right — but it gets progressively better at not being wrong.

"Your goal shouldn't be right. It should just be really good at not being wrong."

But real problems are multi-dimensional. It's not a simple curve going down — it's a complex landscape with valleys and mountains. You might think you've found a good solution, but you're actually sitting in a **local minimum**: a spot that feels like you've optimized, but there's a much deeper valley (a global minimum) you can't even see from where you are.

This is the critical insight: if all you do is take small steps (mini pivots), you might optimize perfectly within your local minimum but never escape it. Sometimes you need a large step — a real pivot — to jump to a completely different part of the landscape where the potential is much greater. Then you go back to calibrating with small and medium steps in that new territory.

The practical sequence is: take many small steps to optimize where you are, recognize when you've hit a local minimum, take a large leap to a new area, then resume small steps. "It's not the big pivots that are going to make you. It's going to be the mini medium ones usually."

## Examples of Calibration and Pivoting in Practice

**PewDiePie** started with gaming videos and took many small steps in his early days — changing the games he played, the people he played with, tweaking his format. These were calibrations. But over time he also took much bigger steps, eventually shifting his entire content identity from screaming at horror games to making videos about his life. Both scales of change were necessary.

**iPhone** went through a decade of calibrations — iPhone 1 through whatever the current version is — each progressively better but none representing a fundamental reimagining. Then Apple Vision Pro drops, and that's a genuine large pivot, driven by the fact that iPhone sales plateaued and they needed to explore new territory.

**Linkin Park** spent their first four albums making relatively incremental evolution on their metal-rap sound. Then around 2010, they made a massive sonic shift toward ballads and pop. Longtime fans called it trash, but it was growth — an evolution that found them greater mainstream success.

**Sharif and Lexica** is the most instructive example. Sharif spent two years working on DeBuild, taking steps he himself later described as "too small every week." Constant tiny iterations, never making large changes, never really getting anywhere significant. Then he made Lexica — a massive pivot where he changed his entire company in literally a week. It got millions of users in a month. He needed to make that large jump because the small steps had trapped him in a local minimum.

## The "Hold Strongly, Hold Loosely" Framework

When deciding what to change and what to keep, the key question is: **What do you hold strongly, and what do you hold loosely?**

What you hold strongly is your core conviction — the deep reason you're making something. What you hold loosely is the specific way you're executing on that conviction. The execution can (and should) change freely. The conviction stays constant.

**Example — Ali (legal AI product):** Holds strongly: "I want to make really great AI technology for lawyers." Holds loosely: "It's a product that helps lawyers make arguments." The specific product could be anything — helping assistants answer emails, helping lawyers get new clients, anything in the legal AI space. The core conviction doesn't change; the implementation pivots freely.

**Example — Nyati (emotional wellness content):** Holds strongly: "I want to help people be more in touch with their emotions." Holds loosely: "I do this via 20-30 second short-form content." Maybe the better path is long-form videos, or a network of vetted therapists, or a nonprofit, or local events. The medium and method should be held loosely.

"What's important is you're not getting locked into a certain way of solving something. You should keep your mind open at all times."

The danger is holding things strongly that should be held loosely. People lock into a specific format, platform, or product shape and stop questioning it. They won't even entertain a great idea for a different approach because they're too attached to their current one.

## The Daily Practice: "What's Changing Today?"

The most actionable framework from the lecture is a single question to ask yourself every morning: **"What's changing today?"**

Not "should something change?" but "what is changing?" — framed as an inevitability, not an option. Something should be changing on a daily basis. It could be tiny (the headline on your landing page), medium (dropping a platform), or large (a fundamental product shift). But if nothing is changing, you're probably stuck.

A complementary question: **"What needs to be looked at from first principles again?"** This forces you to periodically re-examine assumptions you've been operating on without questioning.

## The Decision Framework for Changes

Once you've identified something that needs to change, run it through three filters before acting:

1. **What do others say about the change?** Show people. BuildSpace showed demo videos to seven people before deciding if they were good, changing the video three times based on reactions. Get external signal.

2. **What does your intuition say?** What feels right? This matters, but it shouldn't dominate.

3. **What does the data say?** This should drive 90% of the decision. "Most decisions should be 90% logic, 10% emotion. Shouldn't have to be 0% emotion."

The BuildSpace Instagram strategy was a perfect example of mini pivots driven by data. Every day, Josh would come in and they would look at what they did the previous day, review the data, see what people said, and decide whether to repeat the format or change it. "Almost always it was doing something different." The tight feedback loop of daily content made rapid calibration possible. The anti-pattern: figuring out a format and then grinding out 30 of them. "It didn't work the first time, so why do you expect it to work the 29th time?"

A medium pivot example: BuildSpace stopped posting on Twitter. The data showed that traffic from Twitter was similar to Instagram, but Instagram took 5-10x less effort. The emotional feeling ("this is a boomer platform now") aligned with the data. They made the call to stop rather than continue doing Twitter badly. "You should always just be doing what you feel really strongly about." Half-assing something is worse than not doing it at all.

## Hard Questions to Ask About Any Action

For anything you're spending time on, regularly interrogate it with three questions:

1. **Why am I doing this action?** Have a real answer, not a vague one. Many people post on Instagram or Reddit without a clear reason beyond "someone told me to."

2. **Does this action actually still make sense?** Maybe it made sense when you started, but circumstances changed. Re-evaluate.

3. **What other actions could I take? Is this literally the best action I have right now?** If it is, go hard. If it's not, you're just doing it to do it — and you won't even notice you're stuck in that pattern.

"No matter what you're doing on a given day, it's worth asking yourself these three questions."

## When to Make Large Pivots

Sometimes the mini and medium pivots aren't enough, and you need a genuinely large change. These carry real risk — "you're kind of in this airplane, and if you pull the wrong switch, you may just nose dive." For large pivots, the advice is to talk them through with people you trust before acting.

Examples of large pivots: a musician deciding to build an app instead, a developer pivoting from education into AI hardware. These aren't inherently wrong moves, but they require very strong reasoning. "You have to have really good answers" for why you're making a dramatic change, or it's just emotional whiplash masquerading as strategy.

The overall bias should be toward action and change, but calibrated action: "I would love for some of you to take larger steps, but I think most people are usually afraid of taking larger steps, so they'll end up taking smaller steps. You want to kind of be in the middle."
