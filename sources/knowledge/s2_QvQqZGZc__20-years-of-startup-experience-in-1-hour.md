# 20 Years of Startup Experience in 1 Hour

This lecture distills two decades of building startups into a set of hard-won operating principles. The speaker — who spent 12 years building before seeing something truly work, ran companies including Bebo (2013–2018), worked at Twitch, and currently runs ThirdWeb — walks through the core loops of building, the traps founders fall into, and the frameworks that separate people who think they have something from people who know they do. The central theme: we lie to ourselves constantly, and the entire discipline of building is about replacing internal narratives with external evidence.

## Ship the Toy Version: Where Everything Starts

The foundational lesson at BuildSpace — and the origin of the "GTFOL" (Get The F*** Out and Launch) philosophy — is to ship a toy version of your product as fast as possible. The purpose is not to impress anyone. Ninety percent of people may find it broken, unfinished, unserious. That's fine. The question is: **is there anybody that gives a shit?**

"Once you find one, then you can find five. When you find five, you can find 10."

The speaker learned this through painful personal experience. Early in his career, he shipped things quickly almost by accident — as a teenager and in his early twenties, he just built and released without overthinking. Then he "got too smart for himself" and spent 13 months at a startup building without shipping anything. In month 13, with no money left, the team accomplished more in a single month than in the previous thirteen. That scar never healed: "I will never do this again." It became the driving principle behind everything — the first question he asks anyone is *what have you shipped?*

## We Lie to Ourselves

The most important reason to ship early and seek external feedback is not efficiency or speed-to-market. It's that **we lie to ourselves**. Every one of us creates internal "truths" that are actually fabrications. We do it to motivate ourselves, to maintain belief, to sustain momentum. But the consequence is devastating.

The pattern: you sit in a room, come up with an idea, whiteboard it, high-five your co-founder. "We came up with the best idea in the world." The idea lives in your head. You glorify it. You start speaking about it as fact. Then you make secondary, third, fourth, fifth decisions based on this "fact" — except it was never validated. If the original assumption was slightly wrong, every downstream decision compounds the error. Months or years later, you're deep in a direction built on a foundation that was never tested.

"Don't create these hard facts in your mind unless you really know it. The answer to how do you know it's a hard fact: you don't have to question it. It's so obvious that nobody's talking about it."

## The Boulder and the Hill: What "Working" Actually Feels Like

There's a visceral difference between pushing an idea and being pulled by one. When an idea is still unproven, it should feel like pushing a boulder up a hill — heavy, effortful, every day grinding forward. When something is actually working, the dynamic inverts completely. The boulder has crossed the hill and is rolling away from you. You're not pushing anymore; you're running to keep it in sight.

"I'm waking up and this thing's just running away from me."

For a musician, that feeling might be discovering 5,000 streams happened overnight, or someone posted your song on TikTok and it exploded. For software, it's users showing up without being asked, people describing your product better than you can. The key quality: **"I couldn't contain it if I wanted to."**

The speaker spent 12 years building things before experiencing this. The humbling realization: "Those first 12 years, I thought everything was working. And then the moment I saw it, I was like, holy crap — nothing I ever did worked." Most things work *a little bit*. What you're looking for is something that works *a lot*. And when it does, "it becomes ridiculously obvious."

## Build, Measure, Learn

The core operating loop is simple: **build something, measure its impact, learn from the results, feed those learnings back into the next build cycle.** The discipline is in executing each phase honestly.

### Build: Keep It Tight

The build phase should be compressed to roughly one week. The framing: you have 52 weeks in a year. Subtract vacation (2–4 weeks), illness (a couple weeks), and the inevitable bad weeks where life hits you. You're left with about **40 great weeks in a year — 40 iterations** to run this loop. Every week of unfocused building burns one of those cycles.

Scope down aggressively. Get it out. The tighter the build, the faster you can measure.

### Measure: Ensure Distribution First

The most common failure in measurement isn't bad metrics — it's insufficient volume. "I measured it for a week, but I couldn't learn anything because I didn't get enough users on it." Before you can measure, you need enough distribution to generate signal. If your measurement phase is going to be a week, there must be enough velocity behind it to produce a meaningful answer in that time.

The first priority of measurement is making sure you have enough people encountering your thing. Without that, even perfect metrics are useless.

### Learn: Get Outside Yourself

The learn phase is where most people fail, because they do it internally. They interpret their own data through the same biased lens that created the original assumptions. The most critical instruction for the learn phase: **get outside of yourself.** Find someone — a co-founder, a peer, a mentor, the people around you — and pressure-test your learnings out loud.

Think in ratios, not absolutes. When the musician in the audience said he was "80% certain" that shorter songs with early hooks performed better, the speaker immediately reframed: that means one out of five times, this conclusion is wrong. "If there was a 20% chance I could get hit by a car crossing the street, is anyone crossing the street here?" Even our own estimates of certainty are probably inflated — that 80% is more likely a 60%.

The temptation is to take the positive signal and use it purely as fuel for motivation while discarding the risk. Resist this. Carry the risk alongside the conviction. Your first question after a learning isn't just "why is this interesting?" but "what is the risk?" and "what would it take to move from 80% confident to 90%?"

"If you ever believe that learning is 100%, you need to talk to more people. It's really, really, really hard in any business to know anything 100%."

Facebook is the illustration. One of the biggest companies in the world, and they still made roughly 20 major directional corrections over their history. They were winning on web, dominating mobile — and still went out and bought Instagram and WhatsApp, fundamentally shifting their strategy from one big app to a family of apps targeting every user type. "If Facebook is not afraid to change their decision-making, we definitely should not be. They have maybe a thousand people thinking about this. We have a few."

## The Two Miracle Problem

A common trap founders fall into: planning to perform one miracle, and then — only after that miracle succeeds — perform a second, completely different miracle. "You're literally multiplying your problem. You're exponentially making it harder."

The pattern shows up as: "I'm going to build this huge community online, and then once I have that, I'm going to get signed by a label." Or: "I'm going to build this platform, and then I'm going to pivot into an entirely different business on top of it." Each of these is a separate, enormous challenge. Stacking them sequentially doesn't make them easier — it makes the combined probability vanishingly small.

The corrective: create one target and one direct path to it. If you want to win online, go do that. If you want the traditional path, go do that. Each path has its own unique challenges. Pick one and tackle those challenges directly rather than climbing one mountain as a "warm-up" for a completely different mountain.

## Finding Your 1,000 Who Love You: The Sherpa Framework

Climbing Mount Everest requires reaching base camp first, where you find Sherpas — the guides who actually know the mountain. Building a product works the same way. Your first milestone is not a million users or mainstream success. It's finding a non-trivial number of people who **love** your product — not just try it, not just use it, but love it.

The speaker's team at Bebo built a streaming tool (a competitor to OBS). Their metric: 1,000 streamers who love the product. They defined "love" with aggressive qualifiers — real streamers who stream at least three days a week, six to eight hours at a time, using the tool daily, engaged enough that the team could interact with them. A thousand of those people.

"If you shut it down and a thousand people were screaming at you, you had something."

The people who merely *tried* the product don't count. They wouldn't even notice if it disappeared. Only the people who love it will react, and those are the people who become your Sherpas — they guide you up the mountain. They tell you instantly whether a new feature is amazing or terrible. They become your alpha testers, your beta loop, your distribution channel.

The specific number depends on the domain. Consumer products might need more; enterprise B2B might need fewer. But pick a non-trivial round number: 10, 100, 1,000, 10,000. The number should be large enough that you can't brute-force it by personally calling everyone you know. That forcing function is the point — it pushes you to find real distribution channels and real product-market signal.

For the audience member with 10 users who love his AI study platform: the biggest rock in the way is getting to 100. And the goal isn't 12 (which you can brute-force with two more friends) — it's 100, because that requires solving distribution.

## Seek Your Users Relentlessly

Talking to users is the single most valuable activity at any stage. The speaker still does it while running ThirdWeb — joining sales calls, responding to customers in GitHub and support channels, spending 30 minutes using his own product. "It is that important to get the feedback, and you have to continually seek it."

The Bebo team took this to extremes when building a mobile social app for teenagers. They needed to find actual teens to test with, so they bought Chipotle burritos and stood in a San Francisco mall with a sign: "Free burritos if you try my app." Mall security kicked them out within five minutes. They moved to the sidewalk outside Mission High School. They got a friend who was a teacher to let them into a classroom — only to discover the school had terrible cell reception and every student had a cracked, low-end phone, while the team had been building on the latest iPhones with the fastest Wi-Fi. That single learning — that they weren't even ready for their actual market — was worth more than weeks of internal discussion. They fixed the problems in one week and went back.

Another Founders Inc example: someone building an AI teddy bear was told to go find users. Where are kids? Playgrounds. "Again, sounds weird. Don't be creepy. But there's a way to do this." He found parents at the playground and pitched them.

"If you're not getting no's, you're not doing it enough. You should target 50% no's as a ratio."

The speaker still DMs people whose projects he finds interesting. About 50–60% respond, and that's a good ratio — it means he's reaching the right level of people without being too cautious.

## Creating Structure Around Yourself

When BuildSpace ends, every participant needs to replicate the accountability structure they had during the program. The most important thing to walk away with, beyond the Build-Measure-Learn framework, is a group to do it with.

The ideal group is not a formal board of advisors. Nobody needs to be given equity. You need **people with shared problem space** — people at the same stage as you, or maybe one or two steps ahead. Counterintuitively, the people way ahead of you are the *least* useful. "They're on top of the mountain waving at you. They're not telling you how to climb the mountain." The person who just went around the turn ahead of you has the best perspective on what's coming next.

Founders Inc itself started as eight people in a Discord — founders who were all building things — with a single Monday session called "Ship It" where everyone reported what they shipped, what they didn't, and what they planned for next week. The visible accountability created productive pressure. "There were moments of like, fuck, I'm not doing enough. This person's crushing it."

The speaker's co-founder at Bebo, Sean, had a practice of immediately finding 5–10 people whenever they entered a new industry: a few entrepreneurs who had tried and moved on (they'll tell you everything honestly because they don't care anymore), and a few currently active in the space (for ongoing insight). They'd invite them to dinner. This was a way of building a learning structure around each new venture rather than entering blind.

## Decision-Making: Fast, Scoped, and Scored

Three principles for making decisions when you could go in many directions:

### Decide Fast

"If you're thinking about a decision and a day or two goes by, it's unlikely that you're going to create a new condition out of thin air that's going to give you a lot more info." Multi-day, multi-week deliberation on directional choices typically doesn't help. Most decisions at this stage are closer to 50/50 than founders want to admit. It's better to decide in one day and realize three days later you were wrong than to deliberate for three weeks and *still* pick the wrong side of a 50/50. "We're just trying to get reps."

### Scope to the A-Plus Problem

Your product is like a river blocked by boulders. Every week you can move one. Which one? The biggest one you can actually move. Everything else is noise. Identify the single most important problem — the A-plus problem — and scope all decision-making to that.

For the AI study platform with 10 users who love it: the A-plus problem is getting to 100. Not fixing a bug that might matter in three months, not optimizing something for scale that doesn't exist yet. The scoreboard is the guiding constraint.

### Use a Scoreboard

If you play 48 minutes of basketball and look up at the end to find no scoreboard, who won? Nobody knows. Every project needs a scoreboard — one clear metric that tells you if you're winning. Every decision should be filtered through: **does this impact the scoreboard right now?** If it saves a headache in three months but doesn't help today, "it's a three-month-later problem — we'll deal with it then."

The scoreboard localizes your problem space to what lets you win today. Every stage of a company has a "today" metric, and the discipline is finding it and staying focused on it.

## From "Can" to "Need": Narrowing Your Audience

When an audience member described his Chrome extension as a tool for reading articles faster and said "everyone can read articles," the speaker immediately identified the lie: "That's a lie. Correct? Correct."

The word "can" creates a fatally wide net. The word "need" creates focus. Who *needs* to read articles at volume? A venture capitalist scanning deal flow. A scientist keeping up with research. A doctor reviewing literature. These are power users with urgent, specific needs — and each represents a different persona with different requirements.

Once you've listed the personas, you can't serve all of them. Pick one — the one you feel most confident about, or the one you have the easiest path to reaching — and go deep. Get specific enough that your product becomes indispensable for that group, even if it's temporarily useless for everyone else.

"Most products in the world are not that general. Amazon, the giant e-commerce company that probably everybody here uses — only like 40% of people use it."

The fear is that narrowing makes the opportunity too small. But the sub-sub-genre of house music still has a hundred thousand or a million passionate listeners. A narrow starting point doesn't constrain the endpoint — it gives you the traction to reach it. "Ideally this is still big. It doesn't have to be my final size. But it's big enough where if I just did this, I'd be like, fuck yeah, that's still pretty massive."

The language matters as a diagnostic tool: if you describe your audience in passive, general terms ("people who could use this"), you haven't found your audience yet. When you can describe specific types of people with urgent needs and articulate exactly why they need your thing, you're getting closer.

## Confidence vs. Evidence

There is a sharp line between "I think people might like it" and "I know people need this, and so does everyone around me." Most builders live on the "I think" side of that line — running on internal confidence rather than external evidence. The entire discipline is about crossing from one side to the other.

"Confidence is for you internally. Evidence is with you externally."

The litmus test for "I know": people are coming to you unprompted. Your text messages are full of requests. People aren't just politely nodding — they're demanding the next version, the next event, the next release. The speaker uses BuildSpace's own trajectory as the proof case: Nights and Weekends grew each season, Twitter timelines flooded with excitement, projects spawned organically, people flew from around the world and paid San Francisco rents to live multiple people in a one-bedroom — all without being sold on the concept. That's what evidence looks like.

The practical question to constantly ask yourself: "Am I still saying 'I think they might like it,' or am I saying 'I know'?" If the answer is still "I think," you haven't pushed hard enough. Get it out externally. Do the events, ship the tracks, talk to the users. Either you'll discover that people truly, deeply need it — in which case the evidence will be overwhelming and unmistakable — or you'll discover they don't, and you'll save yourself months or years of pushing a boulder that was never going to crest the hill.

"When you build something great, it doesn't have to be good." A great product — one that serves a massive, genuine need — survives being rough, ugly, or incomplete. A merely good product, one that works fine but nobody desperately needs, has to fight for every user. The difference between great and good is the depth of need, and need is something you discover externally, never internally.
