# 6 Lessons I Learned from Growing 0 to 150K Followers

Mylene makes cinematic Instagram reels and YouTube videos about lessons from her twenties — beautifully shot, reflective short-form content that blends personal narrative with visual storytelling. She started her content journey one year earlier in Buildspace SF1 with zero subscribers, no Instagram, and barely any camera experience. By the time of this talk she'd grown to over 150K followers. But the number isn't the point. What she really wanted to share was how her *relationship* with creating content changed through that year — the emotional arc, the shifts in perspective, and the six concrete lessons she extracted along the way.

If you graphed her relationship with creating content over time, it wouldn't be linear at all. It's a rollercoaster of highs and lows, dips and recoveries, and the whole talk maps to different segments of that curve.

## Lesson 1: Focus on Inputs, Not Outputs

When Mylene started in Buildspace SF1, she was posting one YouTube video per week with a goal of hitting 5,000 subscribers. The goal was actively hurting her. Each week she showed up and the views didn't spike the way she hoped, she'd feel lower and lower. Small wins when a video went up, then right back into the low of wondering why things hadn't blown up yet.

The realization: you can't control who follows you or how many people view your content. What you can control is how often you show up. The metric that matters is the input — consistency of creation — not the output of views and followers.

On cadence specifically, Mylene doesn't believe in daily posting. For her it's unrealistic and strips away the time to actually live, feel inspired, and have stories worth telling. The right cadence is something recurring that still pushes you, but doesn't consume your ability to experience life. Find the frequency that's sustainable for your actual lifestyle, not the one that looks impressive on paper.

## Lesson 2: When to Shift from Quantity to Quality

This insight came from a conversation with April Lynn (Rock's girlfriend — both were SF1 students). The question every creator faces: do I spend two weeks or a month making something great, or just push something out to stay consistent?

April's advice, which stuck deeply: "When you know for a fact that you're going to keep showing up — when you know this is a goal you'll take to the grave, something you'll pursue even on the rainy days — that's when you can start to prioritize quality."

The logic is practical. If you're still shaky on your goals, still unsure whether you have it in you to keep going, and you spend six weeks on a single video, there's a real chance you fall off entirely right there. The perfectionism kills momentum. But once you've proven to yourself that you're not going anywhere — once consistency is a settled question — then you've earned the right to slow down and invest more in each piece.

When you don't know if you'll keep showing up, choose consistency. When you know you will, choose quality.

## Lesson 3: Learn How to Have Fun Again

This is the lesson Mylene returned to more than any other — the emotional center of the talk.

After SF1, she was back in the real world, feeling jaded about metrics. She decided to throw the numbers out and focus on what actually brought her joy in creating. She started spending longer on videos, making things she actually liked. One project was completely unrelated to anything she'd done before — longer, more collaborative, harder to release — but it reinvigorated the joy of creating.

She even opened up to short-form content, something she'd been actively hostile toward. She thought short-form would restrict her creative expression. What she found was the opposite: it let her experiment with ideas faster and more frequently.

The deeper framework here is what Mylene calls the **cycle of frustration**. It goes: initial excitement → create something → it flops → research what works (retention editing, attention economy hacks, tactics that don't resonate with you) → try those things anyway → still doesn't work → frustration. The fundamental thing missing from this cycle is fun. Understanding what is actually fun for *you* to create.

"Fun is what takes an idea from a thought to a finished video most consistently. Fun is what keeps you trying new things even when you feel like things are tough or you want to give up. Fun is the thing that keeps you long enough to see you win."

People usually quit before they have a chance to see their hard work pay off. If you focus on keeping things fun and enjoying the process, that's probably the most surefire way of guaranteeing you'll stick around long enough for it to matter.

### From Fun to Impact

The natural question: will making stuff for fun actually help? Will something silly or random actually turn into something?

Most people think too much about what others want to see and miss a fundamental thing about what they actually want to create. Mylene's approach is to start with genuine interest first, then layer in relevance to others.

During this phase she was in Japan making cinematic reels of beautiful things she saw. They didn't get many views at the time (a few hundred, if that — the thousands came later after her other content blew up). But they kept her creating and experimenting.

As you create more things just for fun, you start to gain momentum again. Once you have momentum, you can find the intersection of fun and impact. The sequence matters: first, figure out what genuinely excites you and what you feel energized making. Then ask how it might apply to others. Her 23 Lessons series emerged this way — she naturally did end-of-year reflections, which interested her, and then she shaped them through the lens of "how might others going through similar things relate to this?"

Start with what interests you. Then tailor through a lens of how it might apply to others. Not the reverse.

## Lesson 4: Experiment with Intention

When it comes to content, there are too many variables: platforms, styles, gear, editing techniques, hooks, music, visuals. It's hard to tell what's actually working when you're changing everything at once.

Mylene compares content creation to baking a cake — many ingredients that combine in different ways to produce different results. Your theme, script, hook, music, visuals are all separate ingredients.

The 23 Lessons from 2023 series was her cake. She kept the theme consistent across the whole series (one lesson per video, same general format) but experimented deliberately with individual variables. For the first five videos, she used the same match-cut introduction. None of them popped off. From the viewer's perspective, scrolling through a feed, they all looked like the same video.

When she experimented with putting the hook first — leading with the lesson rather than the visual match cut — that video blew up. And because she had a library of similar content behind it, people had something to latch onto and keep following. Instead of one viral video where people forget about you, there was a body of work to explore.

The principle: keep a consistent theme so people know what to expect, but deliberately vary one element at a time so you can actually isolate what's working. Reduce variables while maintaining flexibility. A series format is ideal for this — it gives you a controlled environment for experimentation.

## Lesson 5: If the Right People Aren't Coming to You, Go Find Them

Before the series blew up, there was a low point where Mylene was questioning whether any of this would pay off. She reached out to Farza and others for feedback. Farza's response stuck with her — the core message was: how can you look outside of what you're doing right now and control your own destiny? Are there things beyond just making content that can increase your odds?

This reframed her thinking. She felt confident in what she was making. It was fun. She was getting positive feedback from peers. The missing piece wasn't quality — it was distribution and discovery. The right people just weren't finding her work.

So she went looking for them. She spent time on Instagram searching for creators who resonated with her, who inspired her, who she could learn from. She found Adrian Per, who ran a Discord community where he did live work reviews — literally watching people's content and giving feedback. Most creators are too busy creating to seek out these resources.

Mylene submitted her "Dear Strangers" YouTube video (getting strangers to read letters) to one of Adrian's work review streams. Adrian and his girlfriend cried watching it. That moment was a huge motivational boost. Even without the validation of views or followers, knowing that creators she looked up to were acknowledging her work kept her going.

"If you don't get the attention that you want, just go find those people, go see where they're at and try to make them notice you."

She also found that being around people in her specific niche — not just content creators generally, but people making the same kind of cinematic, reflective content — pushed the bounds of what she thought was possible and raised her own bar of quality.

After continuing to show up, continuing to find other creators, her account eventually blew up. And because she had that library of similar content, people found her other work too, creating a growth loop.

## Lesson 6: Going Viral Won't Solve Your Problems

This is the counterintuitive dip in the graph. Everything's growing, the account is blowing up — so why does the relationship with creating content drop again?

"I remember when I blew up, I was just in my bedroom. It was like December right before the holidays and I was sick because I had just come back from Japan. And I was just thinking to myself like, wow, nothing really changed."

Going viral doesn't solve your problems. Imposter syndrome doesn't go away. If you think virality or big numbers will fix how you feel about your work, the truth is it won't. Which is why lesson 3 — learning how to have fun — keeps being the thing to return to. The process has to be the reward, because the milestones aren't what you imagine they'll be.

## Keeping Content Fun by Not Making It Everything

After going viral, Mylene made a decision that surprised people: she took a full-time job. People assumed she'd go full-time creator. But for someone still figuring out her style and what she wants content creation to be, having a job let her treat content as a fun outlet rather than her livelihood.

The practical reality of full-time content creation: once you rely on sponsorships as your main income, once you stop creating, the money stops too. There's no recurring revenue. Having a job removed the pressure that would make content less fun — she could experiment without worrying about engagement rates or whether a video would land a brand deal.

This is an ongoing navigation, not a solved problem. She's transparent about still figuring out whether and how to turn content into a sustainable lifestyle.

## On Sponsorships and Creative Constraints

Working with brands introduces creative constraints for the first time — rules about what you can and can't do. It can feel restricting after creating freely. Mylene's approach: be extremely selective about who you work with. Only partner with brands you actually use or genuinely care about. Try to reframe the constraints as creative challenges — a forced experiment in making something through a different lens. But she acknowledges it's "obviously not as fun as creating stuff completely unrestricted."

## On Staying Consistent

For people who struggle to maintain a cadence, Mylene's advice is to be brutally realistic with yourself. If posting every three days feels unsustainable, try once a week. If that's too much, once every other week. Find *some* cadence, even if it's wider than you'd like, and then slowly close the gap as you get more comfortable. Don't adopt someone else's daily challenge schedule just because it looks impressive.

## On Getting Started

Mylene wanted to create content for a decade before she actually started. Throughout university she was too scared of what classmates would think. She deliberately waited until after graduation to reduce the social pressure of showing up to class and wondering what people thought. Buildspace SF1 provided the additional push — being surrounded by other people trying to do different things helped her actually create that first video.

## On the Creative Process

Mylene's process is intentionally loose. No Notion system, no elaborate workflow — just Apple Notes chaos. An idea usually hits at night while she's in bed. She types up the script immediately — talking points for what she'll say — and can finish a draft in about 30 minutes. She sleeps on it, reviews it the next morning to see if it still resonates, then films within the next day or two.

The key intermediate step: after writing each script line, she adds a line above it describing the specific shot she wants. This shot list means she goes into filming already knowing what she's shooting, which cuts the filming time roughly in half. Without it, she'd wander. She edits in DaVinci Resolve.

Early in the 23 Lessons series, filming alone took a full day and editing another full day. Now the entire process takes three to four hours. That speed came purely from repetition.

She doesn't use ChatGPT or AI tools in her creation process. She tried building a thumbnail advice GPT early on but dropped it. Her ideas come on the fly, and if she doesn't act on them right away, they go stale. Backlogs of ideas just accumulate and lose their energy. The initial activation energy of a new idea leads to the best results because you're not overthinking it.

## On Finding Your Style

Mylene's current focus is finding her own style — and her somewhat counterintuitive approach is to *distance* herself from the niche community she's been part of. The logic: spending too much time around creators who inspire you can lead to unconsciously adopting their patterns, the same way you pick up speech habits from a friend group. She's deliberately going into her "own little cave" to see what ideas and styles she can develop completely independently, without outside influence.

"The biggest differentiator is you at the end of the day. If you show up authentically, if you show up as you, then that's the best way to guarantee that the right people will find you."

The danger of viral success in a niche you don't love: people get stuck making content they don't enjoy because that's what performed. Showing up as yourself and doing things you're uniquely positioned to do is the sustainable differentiator against every other creator.

## On Life After an Intensive Program

For people transitioning out of an immersive program like Buildspace, Mylene's advice is twofold. First, keep in touch with the people you've grown close to — that community is rare and maintaining those relationships sustains momentum. Second, recognize that the transition back to regular life is actually necessary and valuable. Being alone again forced her to see things differently. Inside the program she was grinding weekly and couldn't zoom out. After graduating, having time to slow down and reflect gave her clarity on the bigger picture. Take time afterwards to think about everything that happened and what you want moving forward.
