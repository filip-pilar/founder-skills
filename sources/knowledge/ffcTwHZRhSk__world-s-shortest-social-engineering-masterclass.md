# World's Shortest Social Engineering Masterclass

## The Solo Player Trap

Farza graduated college in 2018 having built several notable projects on his own — one product hit 500K users in its first year and was still pulling 234,000 users annually as of 2023. He'd worked on AI projects (Deep League), self-driving cars, and various experiments. But despite that track record, he felt deeply stagnated by the end of college. He had no idea what to do next, knew his own weaknesses, had a loose sense of direction, and — critically — had no one around him he felt he could ask for help.

"I'd always been so solo in my whole life up until this point. I'd never asked anybody for help ever." He'd reached a decent place entirely alone, but now felt stuck. He believed, for reasons he couldn't quite trace, that he had to conquer the world as a solo player. That belief was baked into his identity.

## The Newsletter That Changed Everything

Feeling hopeless and directionless in 2018, Farza started a weekly email newsletter. He didn't have a grand strategy — he didn't know Twitter, didn't have Instagram. He just had Snapchat and email. So he started writing about what he was doing each week and sent it out.

The contents were wildly varied: updates on BuildSpace (which was a very different product back then), Death Note fan theories ("What if someone doesn't have a name — do they die?"), app ideas, product experiments, personal reflections. He wrote it every week for nearly four years.

Initially, almost no one cared. The first email went to nine people — his dad, his friend Alec, his buddy Sharif, and a handful of others. His dad would reply with supportive messages. Alec would occasionally chime in. On average, he got one reply every two weeks.

Then new people started appearing. David Arnetto, a random guy at Google, reached out saying he'd love to talk about Farza's ideas. They met for lunch. It was a great conversation, though they eventually lost touch. The newsletter was creating surface area for connection, even if slowly.

## How Sean Puri Entered the Picture

About a year into the newsletter grind, Sean Puri — who would later become an internet celebrity and host of one of the biggest business podcasts — replied with five words: "Good luck bro. Let me know if I can help."

At the time, Farza was a nobody. Sean had already sold his first company, so he felt significantly ahead, but he wasn't yet the figure he'd become. They were both relative unknowns. But Sean kept replying, roughly every one to two weeks, to a newsletter that had maybe a hundred subscribers.

The replies took different forms:
- Sometimes just encouragement: "Dope post."
- Sometimes honest critique: "I wanna be like, yeah, this is a dope idea, do it. But in reality, I think this is a fuck. He's gonna waste six to 12 months of his life on this."
- Sometimes blunt feedback on the newsletter itself: "This newsletter sucks now. I miss when it was about what you tried. Now you're just giving unsolicited advice — they're essentially stupid Medium articles."
- Sometimes just reaching out: "Yo, let's talk tomorrow, what's your number?"
- Sometimes deep emotional support. When Farza wanted to leave a company he'd co-founded and had no one to talk to, he called Sean. They spent two hours on the phone working through it.

Eventually they started discussing starting a company together. Sean offered to fly Farza to San Francisco, fund him to work on an idea, meet weekly, and even laid out an equity split. "I'm like mind blown at this point. This guy is really down to take a chance on me and help me."

The key insight: Farza wasn't asking Sean questions. He was telling Sean his story through the newsletter, and Sean was reflecting back — "Have you thought about X, Y, Z?" That indirect form of help was more valuable than direct Q&A because Farza didn't even know the right questions to ask. He came into the startup world knowing nothing, and Sean helped him navigate it through observation and response rather than instruction.

"In 30 emails, 10 to 20 phone calls, this man changes my trajectory." They never met in person until years later. The relationship was almost entirely built over email, with small responses. "Sean's replies were a weekly blessing. I would sometimes write that newsletter just because Sean would reply sometimes."

## Why You Need Help (Even When You Don't Know It)

Farza's core argument: most people suck at asking for help, and most people need help even if they don't realize it.

The reason is stagnation. As you work on anything, you will almost always plateau. The fantasy is a straight upward line forever. The reality is spikes followed by long flats — or even declines. You might be flat for three months, figure something out for three months, go flat again, then actually lose ground for a stretch before the next breakthrough.

Those transition moments — going from flat to the next spike — are extraordinarily hard to navigate alone. "You actually need to do something to really force yourself past stagnation. Otherwise you'll stay in this zone for months if you are just left to yourself." You can break through solo, but it's rare and difficult.

What you need are people in your life who are ahead of you — not just supportive peers (though those matter), but people further along in your specific domain, your specific craft, whatever you're trying to get good at. These are the people who can see what you can't see from where you're standing.

## The Forms Help Can Take

Farza presented a spectrum of what helpful relationships look like, drawn from well-known examples:

**Classic mentor-mentee:** Steve Jobs and Mike Markkula — Markkula gave Jobs the money and helped him start Apple. Skrillex finding Porter Robinson when Robinson was nobody and championing his career for over a decade. Dr. Dre discovering Eminem, still collaborating 20 years later.

**Partnership:** Key and Peele found each other and made each other better, producing some of the best improv comedy work in recent memory. Walt Disney knew he wasn't the best animator, so he found Ub Iwerks, who was a superior technical animator, and they built the company together. Miyazaki was brilliant at making films but terrible at marketing them, so he found Suzuki, who has marketed every Studio Ghibli movie since.

**Everyday help:** Two BuildSpace participants showing each other something on a phone. Small moments of mutual feedback and curiosity. "This counts. You're starting somewhere."

The format doesn't matter — what matters is that someone ahead of you is engaged with your work.

## Three Ways to Get Better at Asking for Help

### 1. Go Direct

The most obvious approach: if someone out there can help you, go ask them.

The framework is simple. Take something very small and specific you're trying to improve — short-form content, Facebook ads, a technical skill. Find the person who is two to three steps ahead of you at that thing (not 20 steps — not Skrillex if you're just starting out as a musician, but someone 10% the size, still ahead of you). Then make a direct, specific ask.

"You're not trying to find people that are gonna save your project or save your life. You're trying to find people that are gonna help you in a very pointed way."

Farza demonstrated this with a live example. A participant named Samia wanted to connect with a music artist named Tal Winder (273K Instagram followers). Rather than trying to DM through Instagram where the artist likely gets flooded, Farza clicked through to the artist's website, found his Twitter, saw his DMs were open and he'd tweeted recently — an immediate potential avenue. "This guy is so small in the grand scheme of things. There is a path to them."

Farza also shared his own recent example: he'd gotten back into coding and had no idea how to build an AI app in the current landscape. So he got on a call with Naveed (an SF1 alum who'd built an AI app) and had Sharif walk him through the architecture on a whiteboard. No shame in it. "We know these people are ahead of us, so there's no shame. We just ask for help."

For most people, the person who can help you is always a DM away. You're looking for people two or three steps ahead, not unreachable figures.

### 2. Open Yourself Up and Let Others Track Your Journey

This is Farza's favorite approach: instead of going to people directly, create an environment where people can find you and choose to help.

The mechanism is giving people the opportunity to help. Sean didn't seek Farza out — Farza's newsletter landed in Sean's inbox, and Sean chose to reply. "If I never sent that email, Sean's not gonna talk to me. There's no reason." The newsletter worked for Farza because he loved writing. But the medium doesn't matter — what matters is consistent, honest output about where you are and what you're working on.

Other formats Farza has seen work:

- **One-page Google Docs:** Farza sometimes writes a single-page document about where he's at and sends it to people he thinks could help, or just posts it online. Several BuildSpace participants had written one-pagers for him, and he found them incredibly efficient — "In two minutes, I understand their story, where they're at, what their problem is, what they need help with, how I can help."
- **Monthly vlogs:** A kid named Ayaan sends monthly two-minute video updates about what he did that month. Farza has watched every one for over a year, occasionally replying with offers to help. "He gives me the opportunity to help him."
- **Direct video/essay updates:** Nishu sends Stavan full vlogs and essays about how his work is going. Stavan sometimes replies, sometimes doesn't. The point is the opportunity exists.
- **Voice notes:** Someone sends Farza a five-minute voice note once a month — life update, work update, how he feels. No pressure to reply. He sends these to about 20 people monthly.

The psychological barrier is vulnerability. "You'll always be like, damn, do I really wanna tell the world or this person that I've been failing for six weeks straight?" Farza's answer: nobody cares about you as much as you think they do. "I'm just a really small fish, to be honest." He's never been burned by sharing struggles — in fact, it creates empathy and connection.

Crucially, this is not about broadcasting wins. "Going online and just talking about your wins doesn't do much." Posting revenue milestones doesn't help anyone understand where they can help you. The valuable signal is: where are you struggling? What didn't work? What did you learn? "Let the other person decide whether or not this is worth their time. You just be honest."

Whether the audience is one person or twenty or thousands, the principle is the same: make it easy for people to understand your situation and choose to engage.

### 3. Be the Type of Person People Want to Help

This is the hardest and most important principle. Farza asked the room: how many of you have asked a teammate for help or feedback? Almost everyone raised their hand. Follow-up: how many came back within a day or two to show them the result? One person.

That gap is the problem.

When someone helps you, you have a responsibility to close the loop — and fast. "You should be back within, at minimum an hour, and at maximum a day, showing them how it went." The result doesn't have to be good. It just has to exist. "You will never annoy a person with results, no matter good, no matter bad, ever. No one's ever gonna be mad that you did something and then it didn't work. They're just happy that you even tried."

Without that feedback loop, each request starts to feel like a one-off drain. "If you keep returning to a person with one-off requests and you don't tell them how the previous requests went, every conversation is a new thread. You want to keep one big old thread. You're writing a book with them, not a new book every time."

Farza posed a series of self-assessment questions:

- **Is it a pain to help you?** When you ask for help, are you tugging someone aside and making it feel like an imposition?
- **Do you make it simple to understand your problems?** Can someone grasp what you need in 60 seconds, or are they sitting through 20 minutes trying to decode your situation?
- **Do you drain the person helping you?** Was it energizing for them to help, or did it feel like a chore?
- **Does the person helping you see the fruits?** People who invest in you over months and years need to see that something is happening — not necessarily success, but movement, effort, response.

The dream scenario: "Do that for 20 days in a row with me — update me, try things, show me what happened — and I will be your biggest fan. I will do everything and anything to help you win in life. Because it's like, oh my god, I'm actually helping, and that feels great, and it sounds like they're also enjoying working with me. We're essentially friends now."

## The Furkan Story: Three Years of Weekly Calls

Farza's deepest example of a help relationship is with Furkan, who runs Founders Inc. "This man single-handedly has changed my life probably like 10 times."

It started with a blog post. In January 2018, Farza wrote a detailed post about a deep learning project on Medium. It went semi-viral (1.4K claps). Furkan read it on Reddit. They didn't talk.

Later, Farza's friend Sharif mentioned Furkan: "I would talk to Furkan because he's so close to UNSF. This dude is like the Elon Musk of video game streaming." Farza DM'd Furkan on Twitter — not with a request, just a warm note: "Hey man, thanks for the follow. My boy Salmon has been talking about you. Glad you're helping his team." Furkan followed up, and two days later they were having dinner at Furkan's office, cooked by his personal chef.

From there, they talked every single week for almost three years. The format was simple: Wednesday nights, Furkan would call, Farza would screen share what he'd done that week, Furkan would give his take — often blunt ("This XYZ thing you're doing is just stupid, stop doing that, try this new thing"). Farza would go try things, come back the next week, and show what happened.

Farza was relentless in creating surface area for help. He added Furkan to his Slack channel (it was just the two of them — Farza was a one-man company), tagging him with ideas and experiments multiple times a day. He shared everything: emotional breakdowns, horrible losses, greatest wins, how his parents were freaking out about him moving to San Francisco. Furkan gave advice on all of it — including how to deal with his parents.

Some interactions were Furkan shutting down bad ideas in real time. Farza once pitched a concept about drone racing for homeschooled kids in Florida. Furkan's reply: "Please stop thinking about this. Stop. Keep doing the thing that you told me about the other week."

When Farza got into Y Combinator, Furkan was one of the few people he could share it with — his parents wouldn't understand what it meant, but Furkan cared. "Finally, I had someone to talk to."

The key to why this worked: Farza was constantly thinking about Furkan's experience. "How can I be the type of person I would want to help? How can I make that fun for the person helping me?" The goal was that Furkan should feel "Oh shit, let's go — what's Farza cooking this week?" rather than "Fuck, I have to hop on a Zoom call with Farza again."

From Furkan's perspective, he was watching someone explore ideas he himself found interesting — it was entertaining and intellectually stimulating, not a chore. The relationship was symbiotic, not extractive.

Over time, the dynamic naturally evolved. "At this point, Furkan's not my mentor. That's just kind of weird. He's more like a brother, more like a friend."

## Help Is Not a Transaction — It's a Relationship

Nobody actually sets out to help you. "No one goes out and says, I wanna help Kieran, I wanna help James. No one does that." When people do proactively offer mentorship, it can actually be a red flag — "Stay away from those people that are like, I can be your mentor. It's like, alright dude, bet."

Real help just happens when you create the conditions for it. You write the newsletter. You send the update. You share the struggle. Someone responds. You close the loop. The relationship compounds.

Farza also cautioned about taking advice too literally. "You should generally be wary of people giving you advice. Always take the other person's take and then decide — do I want to go with that or not?" Never follow anyone's advice blindly. Internalize it, decide if it resonates, then act. "Always take things as takes."

On reaching out to people who seem unreachable: start with a genuine, specific message — who you are, where you're at, what you admire about their work, the specific problem you think they can help with. If they don't respond, keep showing up. Farza demonstrated this with his own DM thread to a Smash Brothers player named Zane — messages spanning from November 2017 to February 2024, spaced roughly every four months, always genuine. "If I can do this, I honestly believe that you guys can do anything."

He also shared that he used to email the Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel once a month for years. Eventually he got a reply — from Evan's assistant, offering an internship application. "Don't do that. Maybe reach out to someone that's a little bit closer to your radius."

## The Self-Assessment

Farza closed with a challenge to stop playing solo:

- **This doesn't need to be a solo player mission.** Open your mind to who can potentially help you.
- **Start simple.** Ask for help today, in any of the ways discussed.
- **Ask better questions.** Instead of asking about your tenth TikTok, try: "Where do you think I'm flopping? Be honest." Or: "Do you really think I'm gonna be anybody in six weeks? Give me the harsh answer." Or: "What am I doing really well? How can I be better at that?"
- **Reach out to someone four to five steps ahead of you.** You have nothing to lose.
- **Be honest, be clear, know where you need help.** "You can't be helped unless you even know what you need help on."

On maintaining relationships with people you've connected with but haven't actively needed: keep them around because you genuinely enjoy talking to them. A participant shared that he has four to five people who reached out wanting to help — he hasn't needed their help yet, but he keeps the relationships alive because he likes them, and he trusts there'll be a perfect moment in the future. Farza affirmed this. He and his friend Shreve have a running half-serious plan to start a company together at 35. The relationship sustains itself on mutual enjoyment and genuine care, not transactional need.

"Worst case they say no. I think that's hard to get your head around, but as you do it enough, it becomes real."
