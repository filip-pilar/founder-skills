# Writing To vs. For Your Audience

## The Core Distinction: Write *For*, Not *To*

Everyone has heard the advice "know your audience." But that phrase has been beaten into meaninglessness. The real reframe is this: don't write *to* people — write *for* people. The word choice matters. Writing *to* someone is transactional, directional. Writing *for* someone means you're doing something on their behalf, something that serves them. When you make that shift, what you create becomes genuinely meaningful.

The movie *Everything Everywhere All at Once* is a clear example. When you watch it — and especially when you hear the filmmakers in interviews — you can feel that it was crafted *for* a specific crowd. It wasn't focus-grouped or optimized for mass appeal. It was made for people who were meaningful to the creators. That intentionality is obvious, and it's what makes the work resonate.

## Who You Should Be Writing For

There's a hierarchy to this, and it starts with you.

**First: yourself.** The first person you should be writing for is you. This is why buildspace constantly asks: would you even stop for this? Would you even read this? If you can't convince yourself that something is meaningful, it's probably not going to be meaningful to anyone else. It's obvious on platforms like TikTok and Instagram when someone is chasing impressions — the hooks are formulaic, the content feels hollow. People can tell.

**Then: your past self.** When Jeff would write with Farza for buildspace, he'd write to his past self from two or three years ago — the version of himself who would have been excited about something like Nights & Weekends. That past self is a concrete, real person with real desires and frustrations, which makes the writing specific and honest.

**Then: a real, specific person you know.** After writing for your past self, think of an actual person you've encountered — someone in the community, someone sitting across from you — and write as if you're trying to convince *that specific person* that this is a worthwhile path. This is where storytelling begins. Not in abstraction, but in the act of trying to genuinely reach one real human being.

## Staying Authentic Over Going Viral

Many builders are hungry to go viral, and that's understandable. Even the buildspace team constantly looks at numbers — "why did this one get under 10K?" But staying authentic pays off. The formulaic approach to content (optimized hooks, engagement bait) is immediately recognizable and ultimately hollow. Authenticity compounds in ways that gaming algorithms doesn't.

## Artists as Storytelling Models

The lecture specifically draws on artists as inspiration for how to communicate, because artists are among the best storytellers in the world. The lessons from how artists communicate can be applied directly to brand-building — even for SaaS companies.

### Kendrick Lamar: Communicating What's Next

Kendrick Lamar's public communication style served as direct inspiration for how buildspace handles its own messaging. In one post, Kendrick wrote: "I spent most of my days with fleeting thoughts, writing, listening, and collecting old beach cruisers. The morning rides keep me on a hill of silence. I go months without a phone." It's personal, quiet, and deeply resonant — especially the line about going months without a phone, which hits hard for anyone who's felt that pull.

What Kendrick was doing was simply telling people: I'm going to see you soon, but I need to go do this thing for myself first. Buildspace studied this and iterated on the same idea across multiple formats — the `/what's next` page, the "what's next" email, the 24/24 messaging — all attempts to communicate the same message authentically, in their own voice.

### Taylor Swift and "All Too Well": The Power of Writing What's Meaningful to You

The Taylor Swift story is the centerpiece case study for why writing for yourself produces the most resonant work.

In 2012, Taylor Swift was about 21 years old. She wrote a song called "All Too Well" and included it on her album *Red*. It was her personal favorite song on the album, but she genuinely believed that while it was meaningful to her, other people wouldn't care much about it. She put it on the album anyway.

The fans went crazy for it. "All Too Well" became one of her defining anthems — the song audiences request at every show. Her concert culture includes fans making friendship bracelets and exchanging them with total strangers, each bracelet carrying different messages. This grassroots, fan-driven phenomenon grew around songs like "All Too Well" that felt deeply personal and authentic.

Two years before this lecture, Swift re-released the album as *Red (Taylor's Version)* — re-recording the songs so she would own her masters after the originals were controlled by the studio. She expanded "All Too Well" into a 10-minute version, which remained a fan favorite, and turned it into a short film starring Sadie Sink (from *Stranger Things*).

The lesson is clear: the thing Taylor thought was too personal, too meaningful-only-to-her, became the thing that resonated most powerfully with millions of people. Writing for yourself — honestly, without calculating what will "perform" — is often the path to creating work that truly connects.
