# 5 Laws of Good Design

## The CHATS Framework

CHATS is a simple, memorable framework for making designs aesthetically pleasing — assuming you've already nailed usefulness and usability. Each letter maps to a fundamental principle: Color & Contrast, Hierarchy, Alignment, Typography, and Spacing. The speaker (Stamon) describes this as "literally a semester's worth of shit" compressed into something simple and actionable. The point is not to overcomplicate it — learn the rules, internalize them, and then you earn the freedom to break them intentionally.

## C — Color and Contrast

Poor color choices and low contrast make designs unreadable. The speaker showed a slide with both broken — the audience immediately clocked it. Even when color is acceptable, bad contrast alone kills a design. The fix is straightforward: up the contrast first, then you have a workable palette to experiment with.

On developing a design eye more broadly: because this generation is so internet-native, most people already have decent intuition about what looks good. The key is being intentional. When something stops your scroll, take a moment of self-reflection — what about it hooked you? Then continue doom scrolling. "That moment — do not rob yourself from that moment of self-reflection." That deliberate pause is what trains your eye over time.

## H — Hierarchy

If there's no obvious visual guidance for direction, viewers default to reading top-to-bottom, left-to-right (right-to-left in Arabic-reading countries). The fix is to make hierarchy explicit — guide the eye deliberately. "It's as if you're feeding a baby mush carrots — read this one first, then read the rest, and they'll be like, I'm gonna do that."

## A — Alignment

Align your elements. Even if color, contrast, and hierarchy are all correct, misaligned content looks like trash. The speaker showed an example that hit every other CHATS criterion but failed on alignment alone — it was immediately obvious something was off.

The crucial point about fundamentals and freedom: "Once you understand these principles, then you have full autonomy to fuck with those. But if you don't understand those fundamentals, you're just throwing stuff at the wall and seeing what sticks." You can center things, break grids, experiment — but only after you understand the rules you're breaking.

## T — Typography

Make intentional choices about typefaces. Don't use three different fonts in one design — even if everything else checks out, inconsistent typography creates visual noise. In most cases, stick to one typeface, at most two. Keep it simple and deliberate. The buildspace font is Manrope (though they were in the process of changing it at the time of this talk).

A small aside on brand craft: the speaker drops hints and easter eggs into their work constantly — new fonts, house imagery, design elements — always looking for "that cracked fucking person" in the community who'll decode all of it. The sprinkles are always there.

## S — Spacing

Both letter spacing (space between characters) and line spacing (space between lines) matter. Design school calls these "leading" and "kerning" — but the concepts are dead simple. Bad line spacing makes content feel cramped and unreadable. Too much spacing feels empty and disconnected. Give things space to breathe, but be intentional about how much. Spacing also lets you create visual separation between components — drawing attention to a headline while making a tag feel secondary.

## Consistency

Once you've mastered the CHATS elements, the final piece is consistency. You want people to associate your visual style with you. The speaker shared that people regularly tag buildspace's team on Twitter with "random black slides with white text in the middle" because that aesthetic is so iconic to the brand — even when it's not actually them. "That's what you're trying to get — that level of consistency where people see something and immediately, ah, buildspace. They just know it." It starts in smaller circles and grows outward. Recognition is earned through repetition — the logo, the merch, the slide decks, all reinforcing the same visual identity. "That's all done by design."

## Putting It Together

Once you've internalized CHATS and have all the checkboxes covered, you earn creative liberty. The speaker showed examples of buildspace's season four designs — each meeting every CHATS criterion while still playing freely with color, layout, and composition. The framework isn't a cage; it's the foundation that makes creative exploration possible rather than random.
