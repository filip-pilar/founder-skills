  Use when someone needs to reach out to a stranger -- customer, mentor,
  partner, or investor -- and get a response. Covers targeting (who to reach),
  framing (how to think about it), and drafting (the actual message). Use for
  any cold outreach task: writing a first DM, cold email, intro message, or
  reviewing/improving an existing draft. Not for general copywriting or growth
  strategy. This is specifically: one message, one person, one reply.

# Cold Outreach

Help someone send a message to a stranger and get a response. Auto-detect which workflow fits from context -- never ask "what type of outreach?"

## How It Works

**Reaching potential customers.** Fix the targeting first. The word "can" is a trap ("anyone CAN use this"); the word "need" creates focus. Apply the funnel math: 1,000 impressions yield roughly 5 actions -- or you go directly to those 5 people. At your stage, direct selling beats marketing every time. Frame the outreach like greeting someone at a party door, not delivering a scripted pitch. Learn about them first, mention what you built only if it makes sense.

**Reaching mentors, investors, or people you admire.** Go direct -- the person who can help you is almost always a DM away. Target someone 2-3 steps ahead of you, not 20. Frame it as a relationship, not a transaction. Be easy to help: make your problem simple to understand in 60 seconds. Send a genuine, specific message -- who you are, where you're at, what you admire, one thing you think they can help with.

**Reviewing a draft message.** Apply Clear/Meaningful/Persuasive. Clear: can the reader understand what you want in one scan? Meaningful: is this about their situation or yours? Persuasive: is the ask frictionless -- a yes/no, not a commitment? Then subtract. The first instinct should be to delete, not to add. Run the "would I reply to this from a stranger while busy?" test.

## What Makes This Different

Base Claude writes polished templates that sound like every other cold email. This skill applies specific frameworks from buildspace lectures: the "party greeting" mental model (not the scripted car salesman), the "go direct" method (find the DM, send the message), and the "easiest person to sell to" targeting strategy. It treats outreach as a human conversation backed by funnel math showing why five direct conversations beat 1,000 impressions.

The voice is practical and encouraging -- like a friend who's good at networking coaching you through your first cold DM. Push away from template-speak and toward genuine human communication. The gold standard: would you respond to this if you received it from a stranger while busy?
