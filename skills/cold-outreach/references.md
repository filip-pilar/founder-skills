## Targeting: Who to Reach

**Framework: Pick the easiest person to sell to.** Most people default to the hardest customer. BuildSpace's origin story is the cautionary tale -- they built a cloud IDE and tried selling to universities (6-12 month contracts) and students (no money). "We picked the hardest people in the world to sell to." The fix: list 3-5 specific personas who need what you built, then pick the one with the shortest path to yes.

**The funnel math:** 1,000 people see your post -> 100 click -> 10 engage -> 5 take action. Or: go directly to those 5 people. BuildSpace found their first 3,500 users through relationships with 100 college CS Discord moderators -- each group yielded about 35 users. That's targeted selling, not marketing.

"Your goal is not to pretend like you sell a Mercedes. It's to find the people that are down to rock the 96 Civic."

## The Party Greeting: How to Frame It

**Framework: Be the person welcoming someone at the door, not the scripted car salesman.** Farza's dad sold cars at one of the highest-performing dealerships in the country. He never pitched. He spent 10-20 minutes learning about the person -- their family, their commute, their life -- and only then, if it made sense, suggested something. The other salespeople delivered scripted pitches and got awkward deflections.

Your goal on a call, in an email, or in a DM: learn about them first. Present a solution only if you have one. "Stop marketing, start selling."

## Go Direct: Finding the Path

**Framework: The person who can help you is a DM away.** Find someone 2-3 steps ahead of you -- not 20 steps, not unreachable. Check their Twitter for open DMs, look at their website for contact info, see if they've been active recently. Farza demonstrated this live: a participant wanted to reach an artist with 273K followers, and within minutes they found open DMs through the artist's website.

"Worst case they say no."

**Example:** Farza DM'd Furkan on Twitter with a warm, specific note -- not a request. Two days later they were having dinner. From there, weekly calls for almost three years. That relationship started from one genuine message.

## The Message: Clear, Meaningful, Persuasive

**Framework: Clear/Meaningful/Persuasive** -- the writing equivalent of usable/useful/beautiful.

- **Clear:** Can the reader understand what you want in one scan? Bold or front-load the key point. "The worst case scenario is that you put something out into the world, people can't even say yes, and they can't even say no. So they just scroll right past."
- **Meaningful:** Is this about their situation or yours? The scripted salesman talks about the car. The good salesman asks about your life.
- **Persuasive:** Is the ask frictionless? "I got two ideas, one for Milk Road, one for MFM. Want to hear them?" -- that's a yes/no. Not a 30-minute call request.

**Gold standard:** The cold email to Shaan Puri. Clear intent, bolded key points, frictionless close. He got hired.

**Editing rule: Write with an eraser.** The first move is always to subtract. Cut jargon, cut throat-clearing, cut anything that makes the reader work. Aim for a low reading level -- Hemingway App is your friend.

## Building the Relationship: Not the Transaction

**Framework: Help is a relationship, not a transaction.** When someone helps you, close the loop fast -- within an hour minimum, a day maximum. Show them how it went. The result doesn't have to be good. It just has to exist.

"You will never annoy a person with results, no matter good, no matter bad, ever."

Without that feedback loop, every conversation is a new thread. You want one big old thread -- you're writing a book with them, not a new book every time. That's what turns a cold message into an ongoing relationship.
