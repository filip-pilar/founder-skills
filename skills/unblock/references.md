# Unblock -- Reference Frameworks

## Local Minimum

**Framework:** Loss landscape / calibration vs. pivot.

Training a neural network is a good analogy. The loss curve goes down over time -- you get less wrong. But the landscape is multi-dimensional, full of valleys. You can optimize perfectly within your valley and still be nowhere near the global minimum. Small steps (calibrations) won't escape a local minimum. You need a large jump to a completely different part of the landscape.

- "Your goal shouldn't be right. It should just be really good at not being wrong."
- Ask: what do you hold strongly (core conviction) vs. hold loosely (specific execution)?
- Ask every morning: "What's changing today?"

**Story:** Sharif spent two years on DeBuild taking steps he later described as "too small every week." Constant tiny iterations, never large changes. Then he made Lexica -- changed his entire company in a week. It got millions of users in a month.

## Perfectionism / Ship the Toy Version

**Framework:** Useful > usable > beautiful. One-week build cycles.

The question is not "is this good?" It's "is there anybody that gives a shit?" Once you find one, you find five. Once you find five, you find ten. Scope your build to one week. You have roughly 40 great weeks in a year -- each week of unfocused building burns one.

- "When you build something great, it doesn't have to be good." A product that serves a massive genuine need survives being rough, ugly, or incomplete.
- The speaker spent 13 months building without shipping. In month 13, with no money left, accomplished more in a single month than the previous twelve. "I will never do this again."

**Steps:** What can you build in one week that is useful, even if it isn't usable or beautiful? Build it. Ship it. Measure it.

## Burnout / Two Types of Focus

**Framework:** Type One (locked-in execution toward a clear goal) and Type Two (deliberate play, training, testing limits). On-season / off-season with two-week goal cycles.

- "I think it's unrealistic to be on all the time. Because my feeling is that you have emotions and you have limits that you don't even know yet and you'll probably break down."
- Patience means you've done something and you're awaiting the result. Waiting means you're sitting around hoping something happens. "A lot of people end up in that scenario where they're just waiting for magic to magically happen to them. But it's not gonna happen."

**Steps:** Declare an explicit off-season with an end date. Set light two-week goals that guide exploration without demanding relentless execution. Every two weeks, ask: what are we doing for the next 14 days?

## Solo Player Trap

**Framework:** Go direct. Open yourself up. Close the loop.

Find someone 2-3 steps ahead of you -- not 20 steps. Make a specific ask. Show results within a day, good or bad. "You will never annoy a person with results, no matter good, no matter bad, ever."

- "Help is a relationship, not a transaction." Every request without follow-up starts a new thread. You want one long thread -- you're writing a book with them, not a new book every time.

**Formats for opening up:** Weekly newsletter, one-page Google doc, monthly two-minute vlog, voice notes. Give people the opportunity to help. Sean Puri replied to a nine-person newsletter and changed Farza's trajectory in 30 emails and 10-20 phone calls.

**Story:** Furkan and Farza talked every Wednesday night for nearly three years. Farza screen-shared what he'd built that week, Furkan gave his blunt take, Farza went and tried things and came back. The relationship started with a blog post and a warm DM.

## Wrong Audience

**Framework:** Pick the easiest person to sell to. Stop marketing, start selling.

The word "can" creates a fatally wide net. The word "need" creates focus. Who NEEDS what you're building? List specific personas. Pick the one you have the easiest path to reaching.

- Funnel math: 1,000 people see your post, 10 click through, 1 clicks the CTA, 0.5 complete the action. "A lot of you send 100 people to your stuff and then nothing happens." If your goal is 5 people taking action, go directly to those 5 instead.
- "Your goal is not to pretend like you sell a Mercedes. It's to find the people that are down to rock the 96 Civic that you have."

**Story:** BuildSpace tried selling to schools (6-12 month contracts) then students (no money). "We picked the hardest people in the world to sell to." They found college CS Discord groups instead -- 100 moderator relationships, 35 users each, 3,500 sign-ups.

## Emotional Decision Dressed as Logical

**Framework:** Name the emotion. Test it with time.

If your decision is emotional, don't pretend it's logical. The principle isn't that emotional decisions are wrong -- it's that you must know why you're making them. If impatience drives the decision and it works, great. If it fails, at least you know it was impatience, not a flaw in your strategy.

- "Should I keep pushing or quit and try something better?" The rationalization: "I'm not progressing, I have to change." The reality, many times: just needing a two-day break, after which everything felt fine again.
- If the same decision keeps resurfacing after breaks, it's probably a real pattern, not just a mood.

**Steps:** Take a two-day break from the decision. If it still feels urgent afterward, it's real. If it dissolves, it was a mood. For significant decisions, take more time and be skeptical of the impulse.
