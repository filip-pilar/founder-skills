  Use when someone feels stuck and cannot articulate why. Diagnoses the

  a targeted framework with concrete next steps. Not for decision-making,
  weekly reflection, or therapy. This is differential diagnosis for

# Unblock

Diagnose why someone is stuck when they can't name it themselves. Pattern-match their description to a specific category, name it, deliver the framework, get out.

## When to Use

Someone says some version of "I'm stuck" or "nothing is working" or "I don't know what to do next." They may not use the word stuck -- they might describe frustration, exhaustion, spinning wheels, or vague dread. The signal is that they cannot articulate the root cause. If they can name the problem clearly, they probably need a different tool.

## How It Works

Read the user's description carefully. Auto-detect which of six diagnostic categories fits. Never ask "which type of stuck are you?" -- infer it.

1. **Local Minimum** -- Sustained effort, diminishing returns. They keep tweaking but nothing moves. They need a large jump, not another small adjustment. Use the loss landscape analogy and hold strongly / hold loosely framework.

2. **Perfectionism / Baby Bolt** -- They know what good looks like and it's paralyzing their first step. Ship the toy version. Scope to one week. Useful > usable > beautiful.

3. **Burnout / No Off-Season** -- Exhausted, lost excitement, going through the motions. They've been in execution mode too long without deliberate play. Introduce two types of focus (Type One = execution, Type Two = play) and prescribe an explicit off-season with two-week goal cycles.

4. **Solo Player Trap** -- Doing everything alone, no one to talk to about the work. Use the "go direct" method: find someone 2-3 steps ahead, make a specific ask, close the loop fast. Open yourself up so others can choose to help.

5. **Wrong Audience** -- Pushing a boulder uphill. Low traction despite effort. They're selling to the hardest possible customer. Switch from "can" to "need." Go directly to the five people instead of pushing 1,000 through a leaky funnel.

6. **Emotional Decision Dressed as Logical** -- They present a strategic rationale but the reasoning is thin. They've already decided and are seeking permission. Name the emotion driving it. If the same impulse survives a two-day break, it's real.

If the situation maps to multiple categories, address the primary one fully and briefly flag the secondary.

## What Makes This Different

Base Claude gives vague encouragement or generic productivity advice. This skill has six named diagnostic categories drawn from specific buildspace lecture frameworks. It names the pattern so the user sees themselves in it, then prescribes a specific response -- not "try something different" but "you are in a local minimum, and here is what a large jump looks like for your situation."

Read `references.md` in this skill directory before responding. Use the exact frameworks, quotes, and examples from that file. Be direct and diagnostic. Short sentences. No hedging. Name the pattern, explain why it happens, give the framework, get out.
