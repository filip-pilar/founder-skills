# Copywriter — Reference Material

Frameworks, principles, and examples drawn from buildspace lectures. Organized by theme.

## Clarity First

**The CMP Framework.** Good writing must be Clear, Meaningful, and Persuasive — in that order. Direct parallel to good design being usable, useful, and beautiful. The first two do 95% of the work. If you nail clear and meaningful, persuasion is mostly just showing up consistently.

- Clear: people understand what you're saying
- Meaningful: it matters to them
- Persuasive: they take the action you want

"The worst case scenario is that you put something out into the world, people can't even say yes, and they can't even say no. So they just scroll right past."

**The Party Test.** If someone introduced themselves this way at a gathering, would you understand what they do? Applied to bios, headlines, landing pages — anywhere a stranger meets your words for the first time. "This is not the place to be creative." Clarity first, personality second. You cannot skip steps.

**The Hemingway Standard.** Use hemingwayapp.com to check readability. Aim for grade 6 or below unless your audience is explicitly technical. The buildspace email about their show scored grade 1.

## Write With an Eraser

**The Subtraction Principle.** Writing gets better when you remove things. Charlie Munger's inversion: instead of figuring out what to add, figure out what to stop doing. The path to stronger writing runs through deletion.

**Live editing proof.** A job application was workshopped live. The audience's instinct was to delete — whole paragraphs, filler words, unnecessary qualifiers. The rewrite was dramatically shorter but communicated more. Every sentence did real work.

"Most people write too much because they're afraid of leaving something out. The counterintuitive move is that leaving things out is exactly what makes the remaining words land harder."

**Example — the rewritten application.** Original: wall of text, no links, no clear ask. Rewrite: opens with specificity ("I really like the content you're putting out"), lists credentials then undercuts them ("none of that matters"), ends with a frictionless ask ("check out three things I made, hit me up for a chat") plus a specific observation ("your YouTube sucks, so I'm going to help"). Three links. Easy yes or no.

## Momentum and Brevity

**Short sentences pull readers forward.** Boom, boom, boom. The reader can't stop because each sentence is too short to be a stopping point.

**Pat from Starter Story:** "Hey there, Pat here. Happy Wednesday. I have a confession. Starter Story would have failed miserably without the help of one place." You can't help but keep reading.

**Sticker Mule — the masterclass:** "Hello. Tape is half off today. Get 100 feet of custom tape for only $9. Normally $19, free shipping." That's the entire email. It hits hard because it respects the reader's time.

**Chivas Regal ad:** Uses "because" as a rhythmic engine — "Because I have known you all my life, because a red Rudge bicycle once made me the happiest boy on the street..." Builds and builds until you're holding a bottle.

**Practical rule:** Keep sentences short. Avoid jargon. One idea per sentence.

## Write For, Not To

**The distinction.** Writing *to* someone is transactional. Writing *for* someone means you're doing something on their behalf. When you make that shift, the care shows up in the work.

**The hierarchy:**
1. Write for yourself first. If you wouldn't stop scrolling for your own copy, it's not meaningful.
2. Write for your past self — the version of you from two or three years ago.
3. Write for a specific real person you know, sitting across from you.

"The thing you think is too personal, too niche, too much you — that's often exactly what resonates." Taylor Swift thought "All Too Well" was too personal. It became one of her biggest anthems.

## Value Proposition Clarity

**Be specific. Use numbers. Never be vague.** "The all-in-one platform for X" is explicitly banned. Replace with concrete quantities, specific outcomes, clear who-and-what.

- Vague: "A tool to manage your cloud using code"
- Specific: Concrete numbers, clear picture of value delivered

**The curiosity gap.** Create an open loop the reader can't leave unresolved. The $4K business thread: "Three months ago, I bought a business making $500/month for $4,000. It's now worth $100K." Two sentences. Everyone wants the how. Concrete specificity creates the gap.

**Frameworks are ingredients, not rules.** Sometimes you emphasize one heavily and strip back the rest. "If you're cooking a ribeye steak, you might want it to just be ribeye steak."

## Congruence

**Bio, feed, and voice must point in the same direction.** If your bio says one thing and your content shows another, you've lost the visitor. Everything needs to be hyper-focused.

**The sequential framework:** Clear bio first, congruent feed second, voice third. "You really cannot skip steps to get here."

**The Honda Civic principle.** Don't sell a Mercedes when you have a 1996 Honda Civic. Match your copy to what you actually offer today. Find the people who want the Civic — they exist, and honest copy will reach them. Credibility comes from coherence between what you claim and what you show, not from inflated language.

**Example — Duolingo.** Bio: "Free language education for the world." Completely straightforward. They earned the right to post unhinged memes only after the audience understood the product. Clarity first, personality second.
