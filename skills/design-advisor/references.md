# Design Advisor — Reference Frameworks

Source material extracted from buildspace lectures by Stavan (Stamon). Organized by theme for quick retrieval during design critique and planning.

## The Holy Trinity: Useful > Usable > Beautiful

The strict priority order for all design decisions. Every design must be useful first, usable second, beautiful third.

- **Useful**: Does it solve a real problem or meet a genuine need? If not, nothing else matters.
- **Usable**: Can someone interact with it without effort or confusion? "They're not here to solve a fucking puzzle or mystery."
- **Beautiful**: Aesthetically pleasing — but never at the expense of the first two.

**The Dribbble Trap**: Starting with beauty before usefulness. "Starting here is no different than just being a snake oil salesman." If something looks gorgeous but the value proposition is unclear or the user flow is confusing, it has failed at the more important layers.

**Example**: A video that looks visually stunning but nobody engages with — that's the signal it wasn't useful enough. Analytics don't lie.

## CHATS Diagnostic

A five-point checklist for evaluating the visual layer of any design. Apply only after usefulness and usability are addressed.

- **C — Color & Contrast**: Poor contrast makes designs unreadable. Fix contrast first, then experiment with palette. Even good colors fail with bad contrast.
- **H — Hierarchy**: Without visual guidance, people default to top-to-bottom, left-to-right. Make hierarchy explicit — guide the eye deliberately to what matters most.
- **A — Alignment**: Misaligned elements look like trash even when everything else is correct. Align your elements. "Once you understand these principles, then you have full autonomy to fuck with those. But if you don't understand those fundamentals, you're just throwing stuff at the wall and seeing what sticks."
- **T — Typography**: One typeface, two weights max. Three different fonts in one design creates visual noise regardless of everything else.
- **S — Spacing**: Both letter spacing and line spacing matter. Bad spacing makes content cramped and unreadable. Too much feels empty. Give things room to breathe, intentionally.

**Capstone — Consistency**: After CHATS is mastered, consistency builds recognition. But in the beginning, exploration takes priority over consistency.

**Training the eye**: When something stops your scroll, pause for self-reflection — what about it hooked you? "That moment — do not rob yourself from that moment of self-reflection."

## Steal Like an Artist

The reference-based design process. Don't design from nothing — find what works and adapt it.

- Study 2-3 reference sites or apps in the same space. Note structural patterns, not surface aesthetics.
- Building a reference library is a background process — screenshots, saved content, mental catalog. Start by being intentional about saving what resonates during normal browsing.
- Apply your own interpretation to borrowed structures. The buildspace team spent 8-10 hours consuming reference material for a single promo video, landing on a Google Super Bowl ad for emotional arc and A24's loading animation for visual style.

**Example**: The NFC device landing page — stripped to essentials in two minutes. What is it? How many units? When does it ship? Explicit, concrete, scannable. "You're asking them to give 15, 30 seconds of their life. For what in return?"

## Iteration Over Perfection

Ship fast, learn fast. Volume beats polish.

- **The photography experiment**: A class split into two groups. One had to produce a single perfect photo for the semester. The other had to take 100 photos in 100 days. The 100-photo group produced far better work. "Don't aim for perfection, aim for iteration."
- **The Baby Bolt mental model**: A baby learning to walk doesn't know about Usain Bolt. If it did, it would never take the first step. People have full context on greatness — Jobs, Gates, Swift — and that context paralyzes them. "A baby is not Bolt." Stop comparing to the endpoint. Take the first steps.
- **Share early**: "They're following you for the journey, not the destination." Showing only the polished end result robs your audience of the story.
- **Variable Lottery Tickets**: Every post is a lottery ticket. If you've already created the content, cross-posting costs almost nothing. "You've built this house — let's create more doors for people to come in."

## The Tool Is Irrelevant

Do not fall in love with tools. Do not spend days evaluating them.

- **The Madlib example**: One of the greatest producers of all time has used nothing but an iPad and GarageBand for the past decade. "You would never tell that those were the tools he was using."
- "Would you fall in love with the fucking pencil? No. Same thing."
- Start with what you know — pen and paper, Canva, whatever. If learning a new tool takes two months, that's two months of feedback you missed.

## Design Process Pipeline

The concrete sequence from idea to shipped work:

1. **Pen and paper** — Sketch the concept within minutes. Show someone immediately.
2. **Low-fidelity wireframe** (Excalidraw or equivalent) — Rough out flows, sections, hierarchy. Address usefulness and usability here.
3. **Get feedback** — Before moving to high fidelity. "I could have gone into Figma, spent two, three days on it, but I'm robbing myself of that."
4. **Refine and ship** — Build the real thing. "This idea flopped — it was trash. But we shipped it in two weeks versus spending all this time making it pretty."
5. **Learn and iterate** — The reps reveal the inefficiencies. Don't create unscalable mountains in your head.
