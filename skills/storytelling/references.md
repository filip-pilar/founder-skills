# Storytelling — Reference Frameworks

Source material drawn from buildspace SF lectures. Use these frameworks, quotes, and examples when guiding users through narrative work.

## Finding Your Story

**The "Write For, Not To" Principle.** Don't write *to* people — write *for* people. Writing *to* is transactional. Writing *for* means you're doing something on their behalf. When you make that shift, what you create becomes genuinely meaningful.

**Work backwards from intent.** Before you write anything, figure out what you actually want to say — and what you want the audience to *do*. Then figure out how to say it. "What do you want to say to people? I think that's actually a really difficult thing."

**The Taylor Swift test.** In 2012, Taylor Swift wrote "All Too Well" — her personal favorite on the album *Red*. She genuinely believed other people wouldn't care much about it. She put it on anyway. It became one of her defining anthems. The thing she thought was too personal, too meaningful-only-to-her, became the thing that resonated most powerfully with millions. The most personal work is almost always the most universal.

*Application:* When someone says "this part is too specific" or "nobody else would care about this detail" — that's your signal. Push them deeper into it, not away from it.

## The Audience Hierarchy

**Three levels, in order:**
1. **Yourself.** Would you even stop for this? "If you can't convince yourself that something is meaningful, it's probably not going to be meaningful to anyone else."
2. **Your past self.** The version of you from two or three years ago — a concrete, real person with real desires and frustrations. This makes writing specific and honest.
3. **One specific real person.** Someone you have actually met who represents your audience. "This is where storytelling begins. Not in abstraction, but in the act of trying to genuinely reach one real human being."

*Application:* Walk users through all three levels. The origin story told for yourself will be raw. Rewritten for your past self, it gains empathy. Rewritten for one specific person, it gains clarity and purpose.

## Building Your Voice

**The Congruence Sequence: bio → feed → voice.** Strict order. If your bio is unclear, nothing else matters. If your feed doesn't reinforce your bio, your voice is irrelevant.

**The party test.** If you introduced yourself the way your bio reads, would the person at the party know what to do with that information? "This is not the place to be creative." Your bio should state what you do in the simplest possible terms.

**Rohit's rewrite:** From "Rohu Films" (communicates almost nothing) to "Building a school to teach anyone how to make better films" (immediately tells a story). One sentence, completely transformed.

**Earn the right to be creative.** Duolingo posts unhinged memes — but everyone already knows what Duolingo is. "You really cannot skip steps to get here." Clarity first, personality second. Always.

**The Venn diagram.** What you like making vs. what resonates with people. Your voice emerges from this intersection — not from a branding exercise. Work to make the overlap bigger over time.

**Truth as content strategy.** "A little bit of confession can actually gain a lot of acceptance." Sharing what went wrong builds more connection than broadcasting wins. Pretending everything is going to plan creates distance. Admitting it's hard creates connection.

## Communicating Change

**Map the emotional arc.** For any significant communication, plan when the audience will be happy, when they'll dip, and how you bring them back up. Buildspace mapped this for their one-hour livestream — they knew announcing a delay would make people "sad as fuck" and planned how to earn understanding.

**Balance context vs. mystery.** Give enough context that people understand what's happening. Leave enough open that they're compelled to stay engaged. Don't over-explain defensively.

**Don't be Nolan on day one.** "Very few people can disappear for three years and drop a trailer that fills theaters." You almost certainly can't. Tell people what you're working on. Show the process. There's no downside.

## The Craft of Clarity

**Clear → Meaningful → Persuasive.** In that order, always. "The worst case scenario is that you put something out into the world, people can't even say yes, and they can't even say no. So they just scroll right past." Clarity is the foundation. Most pitches fail here.

**The perception gap.** The critical gap to close is between how you want to be perceived and how your audience actually perceives you. That gap is where most builders lose.

**The party greeting.** Imagine welcoming someone at the door of a party — waving, high five, genuine warmth. Now imagine the alternative: "scan the QR code, go to the back, pay me, authenticate with Google." When you're telling your story, greet them at the door. "Why are you making your life so hard?"

**Samsung vs. Apple.** Samsung advertises "108 megapixels" (specs). Apple shows "Shot on iPhone" (transformation). Your pitch should describe transformation, not specifications.
