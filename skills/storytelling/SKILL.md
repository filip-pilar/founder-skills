description: >-
  Use when someone needs to craft or refine their core narrative — origin
  story, pitch, "why" statement, or brand voice. This is the deeper work of
  finding and shaping the story that connects everything they do. Not
  copywriting (making words effective) and not content strategy (what to post
  when). This is finding the story underneath.

# Storytelling

Help users find and shape their core narrative. Most people can describe what they build but cannot articulate why it matters or why they are the person to build it. This skill closes that gap.

## When to Use

- Someone needs to tell their origin story (about page, podcast, first-time articulation)
- Someone needs to pitch what they are building to someone who has never heard of it
- Someone wants to figure out how to sound online — their voice, tone, or overall vibe
- Someone needs to communicate a change — a pivot, shutdown, rebrand, or "what's next" moment

Do NOT use this for writing specific copy or planning a content calendar. This skill finds the narrative.

## How It Works

**Auto-detect the workflow from context. Never ask "which type of narrative do you need?"**

**Origin Story.** Start with the "write for yourself first" principle. Ask for the 2am version — what made them angry, curious, or obsessed enough to start. Walk through the audience hierarchy: write it for yourself, then for your past self (2-3 years ago), then for one specific real person. Push them toward the personal and specific — the thing they think is too niche is usually the thing that resonates most. Output a narrative arc: before state, inciting incident, vision.

**Pitch.** Work backwards from intent — what should the listener DO after hearing this? Apply the transformation model: what is the before state, what is the after state? Map the emotional arc even for a 60-second pitch. Apply clear/meaningful/persuasive in strict order — most pitches fail at step one.

**Brand Voice.** Follow the congruence sequence: bio, then feed, then voice. Strict order. If the bio is unclear, nothing else matters. Use the party test — would a stranger know what to do with your introduction? Apply the Venn diagram of what you like making vs. what resonates. Critical rule: earn the right to be creative. Clarity first, personality second.

**Communicating a Change.** Map the emotional arc explicitly — when will the audience be happy, when will they dip, how do you bring them back up? Balance context vs. mystery. Authenticity over polish. The tone should be personal and quiet, not corporate.

## What Makes This Different

Base Claude writes competent narrative prose but defaults to generic story structures and corporate-sounding "why" statements. This skill applies specific frameworks from buildspace lectures:

- The **"write for, not to"** principle and the audience hierarchy (yourself → past self → one specific person)
- The **"most personal = most universal"** insight — the thing you think is too personal is the thing that resonates
- The **congruence sequence** (bio → feed → voice) with the "earn the right to be creative" gate
- **Clear → meaningful → persuasive** in strict order, working backwards from intent
- **Emotional arc mapping** — planning when the audience will be happy, dip, and come back up

The skill treats storytelling as genuine self-expression that happens to serve business goals — not a marketing exercise dressed up as authenticity. When the user is being generic, push them to be more specific and more personal. When they are being too clever, push them toward clarity.
