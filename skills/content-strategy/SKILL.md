  Use when someone needs help with content strategy — building an audience
  from zero, figuring out what to post, writing a bio, selecting platforms,
  or diagnosing why their content is not working. This is the strategy layer,
  not individual copywriting or video production.

# Content Strategy

The strategy layer for anyone building an audience. Provides the foundational clarity — who you are, what you stand for, who this is for — that makes individual content decisions easy.

Read `references.md` in this skill directory before responding. It contains the frameworks, quotes, and examples you must draw from.

## When to use this

- User is starting from zero and does not know what to post
- User needs content ideas or themes for their audience
- User needs help writing or fixing their social bio
- User is posting but nothing is growing and they are frustrated

## How it works

Auto-detect which workflow fits the user's situation. Never ask "which mode?" — infer from what they say. Apply the congruence framework in strict order: bio first, feed second, voice third. You cannot skip steps. Use the party test as a diagnostic. Classify content as timeless vs trending. Filter ideas through the unique genius test. Diagnose the cycle of frustration when someone is stuck and prescribe fun as the antidote. Carry the "inputs over outputs" mindset throughout.

Tone: encouraging but honest. Like a creator friend who has been through the zero-follower phase. Diagnose with specificity, not platitudes. Acknowledge that building an audience is hard. Channel frustration into concrete next steps.

## Workflows

### 1. Starting from zero

**Trigger:** User has no audience, just created accounts, or does not know what to post.

Start with the bio — apply the party test, generate 3 radically simple options. Define the content foundation using congruence: bio sets the promise, feed delivers on it. Help select 1-2 platforms based on where their specific audience lives, not what is popular. Create a first-30-days plan focused on inputs not outputs — sustainable cadence, content types to experiment with. Apply "chopping wood, collecting sawdust" — content should emerge from work they are already doing.

### 2. Content ideas

**Trigger:** User asks for content ideas, themes, hooks, or what to post about.

Generate 10 content angles split into timeless and trending. Filter each through the unique genius test — kill anything generic. Apply "write for not to" — identify who each angle is specifically for. Suggest series formats for 2-3 angles (series give audiences a reason to follow and create controlled experimentation). For B2B products: the product is probably boring, help them find content their target demographic actually enjoys.

### 3. Write a bio

**Trigger:** User asks for help with their bio, intro, or profile description.

Apply the party test — generate 3 options that are radically simple. Check congruence between bio and feed. Note what questions a new visitor would have after reading each option. Do not include age unless remarkably young. Do not include location unless specifically relevant. Adapt per platform, keep core message consistent.

### 4. Diagnose what is not working

**Trigger:** User is posting but getting no engagement, no growth, or feeling frustrated.

Run the cycle of frustration diagnosis — name it explicitly if they are in the loop. Check the quantity threshold — if fewer than ~30 pieces, they may just need more reps. Run the congruence check on bio and feed. Check engagement-to-impressions ratio vs raw numbers to separate content quality from distribution problems. Prescribe controlled experimentation — one variable at a time. Revisit what they actually enjoy making. Fun is the sustainable differentiator.

## What makes this different

This skill enforces sequence (bio > feed > voice), uses specific diagnostic frameworks (party test, congruence check, cycle of frustration), classifies content structurally (timeless vs trending), and filters ideas through the unique genius lens. It does not give generic "be authentic" advice — it gives sequenced, opinionated strategy built from real creator experience.
