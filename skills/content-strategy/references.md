# Content Strategy References

Source frameworks and examples to draw from when applying this skill.

## Congruence Framework

**Sequence:** Bio > Feed > Voice. Strict order — do not skip steps.

The bio is a party introduction delivered at scale. Apply the **party test**: if you said this to someone at a party, would they understand what you do? "This is not the place to be creative." Radical simplicity wins — state what you do in the simplest terms. The simplified version earns you the chance to reveal complexity later.

The feed must reinforce the bio. Anticipate the questions a new visitor would ask after reading your bio and let your content answer them. If the bio says "music producer" but the feed is aesthetic photos, the disconnect kills credibility.

Voice comes last. Duolingo's bio is completely straightforward ("Free language education for the world") but their content is unhinged memes and pop culture. That voice was earned — they established clarity first. "You really cannot skip steps to get here."

**Example:** Rohit's bio went from "Rohu Films" (communicates nothing) to "Building a school to teach anyone how to make better films" (immediately tells a story, invites engagement).

## Timeless vs Trending

Every piece of content falls into one of two categories. **Timeless** content is what people come back to years later — it builds your body of work. **Trending** content is tied to current moments, formats, cultural references — it drives short-term discovery through familiarity and template recognition. Neither is better. The point is to balance both intentionally and know which you are making.

A **series format** is powerful for both types: it gives the audience a reason to follow (not just like) and creates a controlled environment for experimentation.

**Example:** Mylene's "23 Lessons" series kept the theme consistent but varied individual elements. When she changed the hook format on one video, it blew up — and the library of similar content behind it gave new viewers something to binge.

## Unique Genius

Your content should leverage something specifically about you — experience, perspective, skills, knowledge. "You can't copy people. Yes, you can copy people and get some success, but then at the end of the day if you're copying someone else's talent and you don't have that talent, it's not gonna work for you."

The process: experiment broadly, notice what leverages your specific strengths, lean into that. Your style emerges from the intersection of what you are uniquely good at and what audiences respond to. Kill any content idea that anyone could make.

## Inputs Over Outputs

You cannot control who follows you or how many people view your content. You can control how often you show up. Focus on the input — consistency of creation — not the output of views and followers. Find a cadence that is sustainable for your actual lifestyle, not one that looks impressive on paper.

**Quantity-to-quality threshold:** "When you know for a fact that you're going to keep showing up — that's when you can start to prioritize quality." Until then, choose consistency over perfection.

## Cycle of Frustration

The loop: excitement > create > flop > research tactics > try things that do not feel like you > frustration > repeat. The missing element is fun. "Fun is what takes an idea from a thought to a finished video most consistently. Fun is the thing that keeps you long enough to see you win."

Going viral does not solve your problems. Imposter syndrome does not disappear with big numbers. The process has to be the reward. Start with what genuinely excites you, then layer in relevance to others — not the reverse.

**Example:** Mylene went viral in December, was sick in her bedroom, and thought: "Wow, nothing really changed." The lesson she returned to most was learning to have fun again.

## Content From Work

**Chopping wood, collecting sawdust:** as you work, content accumulates around you. Show your process. You are already doing the work — content should emerge from it, not be a separate activity requiring context-switching.

**The barber's dilemma:** layer content onto existing workflow. Film the haircuts. Do before-and-afters. React to tagged content. The DoorDash driver who strapped a camera to his bike is the same idea — already doing the job, just adding a layer that costs almost nothing.

"It's free and unlimited." No platform penalizes posting more. "Do not be Nolan on day one" — show your process, share authentically.

## Writing For Not To

Don't write *to* people — write *for* people. Writing for someone means you are doing something on their behalf.

**Hierarchy:** yourself first (would you even stop for this?), your past self second (a concrete person with real frustrations), a specific real person third. If the answer to "who is this for?" is everyone, it is for no one.

"The thing you think is too personal, too niche, too much you — that is often exactly what resonates." Authenticity compounds in ways that gaming algorithms does not.

**Example:** Taylor Swift thought "All Too Well" was too personal for anyone else to care about. It became one of her defining anthems.
