# Growth Playbook — Reference Material

Frameworks, principles, and examples to draw from when running this skill. Organized by theme.

## Marketing vs Selling

**The distinction:** Marketing is building an audience at scale. Selling is getting someone to take a specific action. At the early stage, selling wins.

**The funnel math that destroys you:** 100 people see your tweet. 10 click through. 1 clicks the CTA. 0.5 completes the action. That rounds to zero. If your goal is to get five people to take action, go directly to those five people instead of pushing 1,000 through a leaky funnel.

**The free lottery:** Social media posting is playing a free lottery — keep doing it, play every day. But do not let that be your strategy. That is not a strategy to sell.

> "Your goal is not to pretend like you sell a Mercedes. It's to find the people that are down to rock the 96 Civic."

**Example:** BuildSpace's origin. Instead of making TikToks, they found college CS Discord groups. Built relationships with 100 moderators. Each group yielded ~35 users. 100 groups = 3,500 sign-ups. Ninety percent more targeted than content marketing.

## AARRR as Diagnostic

Use as a diagnostic tool to find which stage is actually broken, not as education.

- **Acquisition:** Where are new eyeballs coming from? Twitter, SEO, ads, Reddit, Product Hunt.
- **Activation:** The "oh shit" moment — how fast does someone realize they need this? Engineer that moment to happen faster.
- **Retention:** Do people come back? **Push** (notifications, emails) vs **pull** (built-in habits where users seek you out).
- **Referral:** Do users tell others? Word of mouth, social sharing, structured referral programs.
- **Revenue:** The north star metric you track obsessively. Does not have to be money — can be active users, watch time, etc.

Most people assume acquisition is broken. The real problem is usually activation or retention.

## Experiment Tempo

**Principle:** Two to three days per experiment. Form a hypothesis, execute fast, decide: double down or kill it. No experiment should stretch into a multi-week expedition.

**Parkinson meets Pareto:** Work expands to fill time. Give a landing page redesign two weeks and it takes two weeks. Give it two days and ship the 80%-done version. Spend the remaining twelve days collecting real data instead of polishing in a vacuum.

> "Everyone's looking for a silver bullet. It simply does not exist. You just have to try a bunch of shit."

**Example — Naveed / Unriddle:** Entered BuildSpace at $2K MRR. Ran every tactic in 2-3 day cycles: targeted landing pages, scraped researcher emails, influencer outreach, Reddit ads, affiliate marketing, Discord posts, direct emails. Found the winner: TikTok influencer marketing. Paid five influencers $50-200 per video. One video hit 600K views. Doubled MRR to $4K over a single weekend.

## Easiest Customer

**Principle:** You choose who you sell to. Pick the person who requires the least push to say yes. Who needs this most urgently? Who has the money and authority? Who can you actually reach?

> "We picked the hardest people in the world to sell to. Schools and students."

**Example — Cloud IDE mistake:** Built a tool eliminating CS course setup pain. Tried selling to universities (6-12 months to sign a contract). Pivoted to students (no money). In retrospect: should have sold to tutors teaching kids to program, where the sale goes through the parent.

**Example — Lucy Moore:** First ZipHomeschool customer. No curriculum existed yet. Every Monday: 30-minute call to learn what her daughter struggled with. Every Friday: delivered a personalized Google doc. A big company cannot do this. That one-on-one relationship was the foundation. Understand the person first, offer a solution second — just like the car salesman who never sold anything.

## Compounding Funnel Math

Small improvements at each stage multiply through the entire system.

**Worked example** (research AI tool, $10/month pro plan):
- Starting: 10K visitors → 1K signups (10%) → 50 paid (5%) → $500 MRR
- Experiment 1 — TikTok influencer: visitors 10K → 50K. MRR jumps to $2,500. One experiment, 5x.
- Experiment 2 — A/B test landing page: signup rate 10% → 20%. MRR → $5,000.
- Experiment 3 — Add $3/month mini plan: captures users who would never pay $10. Another MRR layer.
- Experiment 4 — SEO + referrals: sustain 100K+ monthly visitors.

**Rule:** Change one variable per experiment. Study data between experiments. Make sure you can actually measure before you run.

## Sherpa Framework

The growth roadmap is not "get to 10K users." It is:
1. Find **10 people** who love your product.
2. Then **100**.
3. Then **1,000**.

The milestone is love, not volume. Do not skip stages. At 10, you should know each person by name. At 100, you should know their common patterns. At 1,000, you have repeatable traction.

**Scoreboard metric:** Pick one metric. Track it daily. Make it visible.

You do not need everyone to love it. You need a subset who feel it was made for them — cult classics, not mass-market hits.

## Inputs Over Outputs

**Principle:** You cannot control whether your graph goes up. You can control how often you show up and how many experiments you run this week. Focus on what you control.

**The cycle of frustration:** Excitement → create → flop → research tactics → try things that do not feel like you → frustration → repeat. The thing missing from this cycle is fun and genuine interest. Start with what excites you, then shape it through the lens of how it applies to others.

> "If you're not getting the attention you want, go find those people."

**Experiment with intention:** Keep a consistent theme but deliberately vary one element at a time to isolate what works. Do not change everything at once. A series format gives you a controlled environment for experimentation.
