# Growth Playbook

Stage-aware growth strategy for anyone going from zero users to repeatable traction. Diagnoses where you actually are and tells you exactly what to do — not what you could do.

## When to use this

- User has no users and needs their first ones
- User has some users and wants to grow faster
- User has hit a plateau and does not know what to try next
- User is unsure whether to market or sell

## How it works

1. **Detect the user's stage** from their input. Never ask "which mode?" — infer from context.
2. **Enforce the stage gate.** Fewer than ~50 users who love the product? Stop marketing. Start selling directly. Marketing is building an audience at scale. Selling is getting individual people to take a specific action.
3. **Diagnose the funnel** using AARRR (Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Referral, Revenue) to find where the funnel actually leaks.
4. **Prescribe specific actions** — not strategies, not frameworks. Actions they can take this week.
5. **Apply compounding math** to show how small improvements at each stage multiply through the system.

## Workflows

### Workflow 1 — First users (pre-launch or near-zero)

**Trigger:** User has no users, just launched, or built something nobody is using.

- Apply the marketing-vs-selling stage gate. Show the funnel math: 100 see your tweet, 10 click, 1 converts, 0.5 completes. That rounds to zero. Go straight to the five people instead.
- Run the "easiest person to sell to" exercise. Who needs this most? Who has authority to say yes? Who can you actually reach?
- Generate a direct outreach playbook: 5-7 specific places to find those people (Discord communities, subreddits, forums, events, physical locations) tailored to their product.
- Design a first-touch conversation flow. Understand the person first. Offer a solution second. Never pitch. Your superpower right now is personal attention — use it.

### Workflow 2 — Growth experiments (has users, wants more)

**Trigger:** User has traction and wants to grow faster, or asks what experiments to run.

- Run the AARRR diagnostic. Ask one targeted question per stage. Most people assume acquisition is broken when the real problem is activation or retention.
- Generate 8-10 micro-experiments scoped to 2-3 days each. For each: what to do, hypothesis, metric, kill/double-down criterion.
- Show the compounding funnel math with their numbers. A 10% improvement at each stage compounds into a massive overall lift.
- Prioritize by effort-to-impact. Lowest effort, highest potential first. Apply tight deadlines — work expands to fill time available.
- Reinforce inputs over outputs. They cannot control whether the graph goes up. They can control how many experiments they run this week.

### Workflow 3 — Plateau (has users, growth stalled)

**Trigger:** User describes being stuck, plateaued, or having tried things that did not work.

- Run the AARRR diagnostic to find the actual leak. Often they are fixing acquisition when the problem is retention.
- Audit current activities. Apply the three hard questions: why am I doing this? Does it still make sense? Is this literally the best action I have right now?
- Check for the local minimum trap. Are they optimizing in a valley when they need a bigger jump to a different part of the landscape?
- Identify wasted effort. What are they doing that someone at their stage should not be doing?
- Prescribe a 2-week experiment cycle with one scoreboard metric tracked daily. Apply the Sherpa framework: what is their current number? What is the next milestone (10, 100, 1000)?

## What makes this different

- **Hard stage gate.** If you have fewer than 50 users who love your product, you should be selling, not marketing. No exceptions.
- **AARRR as diagnostic, not theory.** Used to identify which specific stage is broken, not as a general education framework.
- **Complete experiment designs included.** Each workflow produces ready-to-run experiments with hypothesis, metric, and kill criteria. Users do not need a separate experiment skill unless they are testing outside of growth (content format, pricing, product changes).
- **2-3 day experiment cycles.** Not month-long campaigns. Kill fast, double down fast.
- **Easiest customer first.** Do not sell to schools and students when you could sell to tutors. Find the person who requires the least push.
- **Compounding math.** Small improvements at each funnel stage multiply through the system. Show the numbers.
- **Sherpa roadmap.** Find 10 who love it. Then 100. Then 1000. Not "get to 10K users." The milestone is love, not volume.
