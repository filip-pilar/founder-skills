description: >-
  Use when someone wants to design, run, or evaluate an experiment — in any
  domain (growth, content, product, pricing, distribution). Helps isolate
  variables, set kill criteria, compress timelines, measure results, and
  multiply distribution. Not for growth strategy or weekly reflection.

# Experiment Lab

## When to use this skill

- Someone describes something they want to test, try, or experiment with
- Someone has results from an experiment and needs to decide: kill, iterate, or double down
- Someone wants to run a rapid experiment sprint to break through stagnation
- Someone is running sloppy experiments (changing too many variables, no measurement, no kill criteria)

## How it works

Auto-detect which workflow applies from the user's input. Never ask "which mode?" — infer it.

## Workflows

### Workflow 1: "I want to test something"

Triggered when the user describes something they want to try.

1. **Isolate the variable.** Apply the baking cake model: identify every variable in the experiment. Flag immediately if they are changing more than one. "You cannot improve a cake by changing flour, sugar, and temperature at the same time." Help them pick ONE.
2. **Set the kill criterion.** Before they start. "What result makes you kill this? What result makes you double down?" Write it down. If they skip this, they will rationalize any result as positive after the fact.
3. **Compress to 2-3 days.** If the experiment takes longer than 3 days to get signal, it is scoped too broadly. Help them shrink it. Parkinson's Law: give it 2 days, not 2 weeks.
4. **Name the measurement.** What specific number changes? If they cannot name the number, they do not have an experiment. They have a hope.

### Workflow 2: "I have results"

Triggered when the user describes outcomes, data, or metrics.

1. **Pin to a number.** Did they actually measure? "It went well" is not data. What was the number?
2. **Compare to kill criterion.** If they set one, apply it. If they did not, name the pattern — they are rationalizing after the fact.
3. **Decide.** Kill, iterate, or double down. Be direct. If the data says kill, say kill.
4. **If it worked: variable lottery tickets.** The work is done — now cross-post, redistribute, repurpose. Each additional channel is another lottery ticket at near-zero cost. "You have built this house. Now create more doors for people to come in."
5. **If it failed:** Was the variable isolated? What else could have caused it? What is the next single-variable experiment?

### Workflow 3: "I want an experiment sprint"

Triggered when the user wants to test many things fast or break through stagnation.

1. **Design 8-10 micro-experiments.** Each takes 2-3 days max. One hypothesis, one variable, one kill criterion, one measurement method per experiment.
2. **Map to 2-4 weeks.** Compressed timeframe. No multi-month roadmaps.
3. **Enforce build-measure-learn with emphasis on MEASURE.** Every experiment gets a measurement phase before the next one starts. Most people build-build-build and never measure.
4. **Remind them:** Compounding works. Small improvements stack. "Everyone is looking for a silver bullet. It simply does not exist. You just have to try a bunch of shit."

## What makes this different

This is not generic "form a hypothesis and iterate" advice. These are named frameworks from specific lectures:

- **Baking cake isolation** — content/product creation has many ingredients. Change one at a time or you learn nothing.
- **2-3 day tempo** — Parkinson's Law meets Pareto. No experiment should stretch into a multi-week expedition.
- **Kill criteria before you start** — decide what kills it and what doubles it before you see results. Eliminates post-hoc rationalization.
- **Variable lottery tickets** — if the work is already done, every additional distribution channel is a near-free lottery ticket.
- **Measure-first emphasis** — the most common failure is building without measuring. 40 great weeks in a year. Do not waste them on unexamined iterations.
