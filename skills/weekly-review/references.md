# Weekly Review — Framework References

Source quotes and frameworks for each step of the ritual. Read this before running the review.

## Step 1: What Changed?

**Source:** "How to Pivot Your Ideas" — the daily practice of "What is changing today?"

The question is framed as inevitability, not option. Not "should something change?" but "what is changing?" Something should be changing on a daily basis — tiny (headline on a landing page), medium (dropped a platform), or large (fundamental product shift). If nothing is changing, you are stuck.

> "What's changing today?"

Complementary question: "What needs to be looked at from first principles again?" If the user reports nothing changed, probe whether they are stuck in a local minimum — optimizing small steps when they need a larger one.

## Step 2: Inputs Check

**Source:** "6 Lessons I Learned from Growing 0 to 150K Followers" — Lesson 1, focus on inputs not outputs.

Track the INPUT (did I publish, did I reach out, did I have conversations), not the OUTPUT (views, replies, revenue). The metric that matters is consistency of action.

> "You cannot control who follows you or how many people view your content. What you can control is how often you show up."

Have them name their specific input commitments and whether they hit them. The right cadence is something recurring that pushes you but does not consume your ability to do the work itself.

## Step 3: AARRR Stage Audit

**Source:** "The Ultimate Guide to Growth Hacking" — pirate metrics. Also "20 Years of Startup Experience in 1 Hour" — the scoreboard.

Five stages: Acquisition (how people find you), Activation (the "oh shit" moment), Retention (do they come back — push vs pull), Referral (do they tell others), Revenue (your north star metric). Most people are doing acquisition work when their real problem is activation.

> "If you play 48 minutes of basketball and look up at the end to find no scoreboard, who won?"

Ask: Which stage moved this week? Which needs attention next week? What is your single scoreboard metric? If they do not have one, flag it — every project needs a scoreboard. Also ask about the A-plus problem: your product is a river blocked by boulders, and every week you can move one. Which one?

## Step 4: Hold Strongly / Hold Loosely

**Source:** "How to Pivot Your Ideas" — the hold strongly, hold loosely framework.

Hold strongly = core conviction (the deep reason you are making something). Hold loosely = specific execution (how you are doing it). Execution can and should change freely. Conviction stays constant.

> "What's important is you're not getting locked into a certain way of solving something. You should keep your mind open at all times."

**Ali example:** Holds strongly "great AI for lawyers." Holds loosely "a product that helps lawyers make arguments." **Nyati example:** Holds strongly "help people be in touch with emotions." Holds loosely "20-30 second short-form content."

The danger is holding things strongly that should be held loosely — locking into a specific format, platform, or product shape. Ask: Are you gripping anything too tightly that should be held loosely?

## Step 5: On-Season / Off-Season

**Source:** "Become a Master at Focusing Like Kobe and Christopher Nolan" — two types of focus.

Type One: locked in on a clear milestone, not questioning it. Nolan on set. Kobe in the fourth quarter. Type Two: focused on playing, training, testing limits. Kobe practicing specific shots after a loss. Both become destructive at extremes.

> "I think it is unrealistic to be on all the time. Because my feeling is that you have emotions and you have limits that you don't even know yet and you'll probably break down."

Ask: Are you in on-season or off-season? Is that the right mode? Over-indexing on Type One without questioning the goal leads to burnout. Over-indexing on Type Two without structure leads to confusion. If they are grinding without a clear singular goal, they might need off-season. If exploring endlessly without committing, they might need on-season.

## Step 6: Fun Check

**Source:** "6 Lessons I Learned from Growing 0 to 150K Followers" — Lesson 3, the cycle of frustration.

The cycle: initial excitement, create something, it flops, research tactics that do not resonate, try them anyway, still does not work, frustration. What is missing from this cycle is fun.

> "Fun is what takes an idea from a thought to a finished video most consistently. Fun is what keeps you trying new things even when you feel like things are tough or you want to give up. Fun is the thing that keeps you long enough to see you win."

If the answer is NO for three or more consecutive weeks, something structural needs to change. It is not a mood problem — it is a design problem. The process has to be the reward.

## Step 7: One Thing for Next Week

Ask: What is the ONE thing changing next week? Not a to-do list. Not five priorities. One thing. This creates the through-line to next Friday's review. The discipline of naming one thing forces prioritization and creates accountability. Connect it to the A-plus problem from Step 3 — the biggest boulder you can move this week.

Three hard questions from "How to Pivot Your Ideas" to pressure-test the choice:

1. Why am I doing this?
2. Does it still make sense?
3. Is this literally the best action I have right now?
