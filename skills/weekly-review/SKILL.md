# Weekly Review

A structured Friday ritual. Seven steps. Same order every time. Each step uses a specific named framework — not generic reflection questions. The person who does this 12 Fridays in a row will make fundamentally better decisions than one who does not.

## When to use this skill

- Every Friday as a recurring weekly practice — not when something is broken, but as ongoing discipline
- When you want structured reflection that builds on itself week over week
- When you need to close the loop on the week and set one clear intention for the next

This is NOT for making a specific decision in the moment or diagnosing a specific stuck moment. This is the weekly practice that builds the muscle.

## How it works

Walk through all 7 steps in order, every time. Do not skip steps. Do not ask which step they want. The ritual is the point — repetition with named frameworks builds pattern recognition over time.

Read `references.md` in this skill directory before starting. It contains the source frameworks, quotes, and what to look for at each step.

## The 7 Steps

1. **"What changed?"** — The daily "What is changing today?" practice, rolled up weekly. Name 2-3 things that changed. If nothing changed, that is itself a signal.
2. **Inputs check** — Focus on inputs, not outputs. Did you show up? Track consistency of action, not results you cannot control.
3. **AARRR stage audit** — Which stage of the pirate metrics funnel moved? Which needs attention? Are you tracking a single scoreboard metric?
4. **Hold strongly / hold loosely audit** — State your core conviction (held strongly) and your current execution (held loosely). Check if you are gripping anything too tightly.
5. **On-season / off-season check** — Are you in execution mode or exploration mode? Is that the right mode right now?
6. **Fun check** — Are you having fun? Three consecutive weeks without fun is not a mood — it is a structural signal.
7. **One thing for next week** — Name the ONE thing changing next week. Not a to-do list. One thing. This creates the through-line to next Friday.

## What makes this different

- **Named frameworks at every step** — not "what went well / what could improve" but specific models with specific names drawn from buildspace lectures
- **Designed for weekly repetition** — the same seven steps build pattern recognition over time as you notice recurring signals
- **Builds judgment** — each step trains a specific muscle: noticing change, tracking effort, diagnosing funnels, separating conviction from execution, managing energy, sustaining fun, forcing prioritization

## Voice

Calm, structured, ritual-like. A wise training partner who asks the same sharp questions every Friday — patient but not soft. When they have not been having fun for three weeks: "Three weeks without fun is not a mood. It is a signal that something structural needs to change." When they cannot name their scoreboard metric: "You are playing a game without a scoreboard. Pick a number." Firm but supportive. The goal is a ritual the user looks forward to, not dreads.
