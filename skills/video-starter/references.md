# Video Starter — Reference Frameworks

Read this file before every response. These are the specific frameworks, quotes, and examples to draw from.

## Start With Feeling

The foundation of a good video is not a hook, a CTA, or a formula. It is a feeling.

"When you're starting out, a good video should just be a feeling. Before hooks, before CTAs, before any framework — it should feel good to you."

The speaker started making videos as a kid — Hypercam recordings of Counter-Strike Source gameplay with music behind them. No intros, no endings, no thought about retention. Just something that felt right. That instinct matters more than technique when you are beginning.

Your gut check: would you actually stop scrolling for this? If you are making a video just to post it, just to show the world you are doing something, people will feel that.

"Good videos ain't just about good hooks, content, and a CTA." Videos make you laugh, cry, feel motivated, take action. That emotional residue is the starting point for everything you create. Chase making something you would enjoy watching. The numbers question comes later.

## Timeless vs Memes

Every video falls into one of two categories. Understanding this helps you decide what to make.

**Timeless videos** are built around a feeling that transcends the moment. People come back to them years later. A Casey Neistat video posted 12 years ago still draws comments like: "This never gets old. For the last 10 years I keep re-watching every now and then." Timeless videos do not need high production — they need storytelling and emotional resonance.

**Memes** are videos tied to a cultural moment — a template, a trend, a format. They work because familiarity lowers the barrier: "You kind of know what you're going to get." The sweet spot is "familiar enough, but not too unfamiliar." Execution within the template is the differentiator.

Neither is better. For a first video, start with whichever feels more natural. Memes give you structure (lower creative friction). Timeless requires more personal investment but builds a longer-lasting body of work.

## Steal Like an Artist

Do not try to make an original video. Many people have already paved the way — you just have to go find them.

**The 3-step process:**
1. Find 3 videos from creators you admire with a similar vibe to what you want to make.
2. Study their structure — the hook, the pacing, where the music lands, the emotional arc.
3. Mimic the structure with your own content and voice.

"At the end of the day, you try to copy someone else, but you're just going to end up being you."

**The Kat example:** Kat needed inspiration, so the speaker asked what creators she admired. She said Care Crafts. Kat took a Care Crafts video and mimicked the structure — but at the end of the day, it was unmistakably Kat. Her personality, her subject matter, her style came through. The video got about 70 views. Not viral, but a real starting point.

Think of other people's videos as templates. The goal is not originality for its own sake. The goal is communicating your thing effectively.

## The Music-First Workflow

Music is the single most underrated element of video-making. Pick the song first and build backwards.

At Buildspace, many video ideas start from music. Someone hears a song and says "we should make a video to this," and the team works backwards — what visuals match this feeling? What story fits this rhythm?

**Concrete example:** After watching Oppenheimer, the team built a Buildspace video backwards from a single musical moment in the soundtrack. The music was the anchor; everything else was scaffolding.

**Finding music:** Always be looking. Lean into what you already like on Spotify. Familiar songs create an emotional shortcut — "it just clicks" when people hear something they recognize. Instagram's featured audio lists show trending songs if you need a starting point. But the fit comes first — do not chase trending audio just because it is trending.

**Matching pacing:** Fast video, faster beats. Slow and atmospheric, match that. Text and cuts that sync to musical beats make even simple transitions feel intentional.

## Experiment With Intention

When a video does not work, do not change everything. Change one variable.

**The cake analogy:** Your video has many ingredients — theme, hook, music, visuals, pacing, platform. If you change everything at once, you cannot tell what actually mattered.

**The 23 Lessons case study:** Mylene kept the theme consistent across a whole series but experimented with one variable at a time. For the first five videos, she used the same match-cut introduction. None popped off. When she put the hook first instead — that video blew up. One variable, isolated, testable.

**The variable lottery ticket:** Cross-post the same video everywhere. Different platforms have different audiences and algorithms. A video that flops on Instagram might find its audience on TikTok or YouTube Shorts.

"Fun is what takes an idea from a thought to a finished video most consistently. Fun is what keeps you trying new things even when you feel like things are tough or you want to give up."

Focus on inputs, not outputs. You cannot control who views your content. You can control how often you show up and whether you enjoy the process.

## The Self-Check

The most basic and most overlooked quality gate.

"If you don't like it, then others won't either."

Before diagnosing hooks, algorithms, or timing — watch your own video honestly. Would you stop scrolling for it? Would you watch it all the way through? If the answer is no, that is your answer. The problem is not the platform. The problem is the video did not pass your own quality gate.

Also check: was the audio clear? Did the first 3 seconds give a stranger enough context to understand what they were watching? Was it formatted for the platform? These basics matter before anything else.

**Balance context vs mystery.** Give enough context that the viewer understands what they are watching. Leave enough open that they are compelled to keep watching. Too much context and there is no reason to stay. Too little and people are confused and scroll away.
