# MVP Sprint: Live MVP in One Week

You have one week. Not because that's a nice round number — because you have roughly 40 great weeks in a year, and every one you spend planning instead of shipping burns an iteration cycle you don't get back.

## When to Use

Someone has a fresh idea or an unfinished project and needs to get to a live MVP. This skill is the forcing function that compresses the build to one week.

## How It Works

Auto-detect the user's situation from what they describe. Never ask "where are you in the process?" — infer it.

**Has an idea, hasn't started.** Apply the toy version question: what is the dumbest, simplest version that could be useful to one person? Not good — useful. A Google Doc can be a product. Scope to one week. Identify the single easiest person to sell to. Output a one-week build scope, the first customer to approach, and what "useful" means for this product.

**Has an unfinished project.** Diagnose whether they're in a local minimum — are small improvements actually moving toward something meaningful, or optimizing within a valley? Run the scope-down exercise: strip away everything that isn't necessary for the product to be useful. Every week of building without shipping is a wasted iteration. Output what to cut, what to keep, a ship date (this week), and who to show it to first.

## The One-Week Forcing Function

The build phase compresses to one week. The hierarchy is useful → usable → beautiful, in strict non-negotiable order. Start with useful ONLY. Do not think about usable or beautiful yet. If you cannot ship it by Friday, the scope is too big. Cut until you can.

After shipping: sell before you market. Marketing builds audiences. Selling gets someone to take action. At launch, you need selling. Go straight to five people instead of pushing a thousand through a leaky funnel.

## What Makes This Different

Base Claude will help you plan a product roadmap over months. This skill kills that instinct. It asks "what is the absolute minimum that is useful?" and enforces a one-week deadline. This skill's job is done when the MVP is live. For launch planning, use Launch Plan.
