# MVP Sprint — Reference Frameworks

## The Toy Version Mindset

Ship a toy version as fast as possible. The question is not "will people be impressed?" — it's "is there anybody that gives a shit?"

- "Once you find one, then you can find five. When you find five, you can find 10."
- "When you build something great, it doesn't have to be good." A product that serves a genuine need survives being rough, ugly, or incomplete. A merely good product that nobody desperately needs has to fight for every user.

The 13-month scar story: one person spent 13 months building without shipping anything. In month 13, with no money left, the team accomplished more in a single month than in the previous thirteen. That scar became a permanent operating principle — ship the toy version, then iterate.

**Steps:** Ask "what is the dumbest, simplest version that could be useful to one person?" Build that. Ship it. Everything else comes after.

## Scope Down or Die

You have roughly 40 great weeks in a year. Every week spent planning burns one iteration cycle. The build phase compresses to one week. Then you measure. Then you learn. Then you build again.

- "Your goal shouldn't be right. It should just be really good at not being wrong." Small improvements may trap you in a local minimum — optimizing within a valley when the real opportunity is in a different part of the landscape entirely.
- "Don't create these hard facts in your mind unless you really know it." We lie to ourselves. Every assumption you don't validate compounds the error downstream.

The useful → usable → beautiful hierarchy is strict and non-negotiable. "Please start there. Do not start here [at beautiful]." A Google Doc can be a product. A Calendly link can be a product. A manual process you do by hand can be a product.

**Steps:** Strip every feature that isn't necessary for the product to be useful. If removing it wouldn't make the product useless, remove it. Ask yourself daily: "What is changing today?" If nothing is changing, you're stuck.

**Example:** The Buildspace team designed, built, and shipped a full product in two weeks using pen-and-paper sketches straight to code. "This idea flopped, don't get me wrong, it was trash. But hey, we legit shipped it in a span of two weeks versus spending all this time making it pretty."

## Sell Before You Market

Marketing builds audiences. Selling gets someone to take action. At launch, you need selling.

- "Your goal is not to pretend like you sell a Mercedes. It's to find the people that are down to rock the 96 Civic that you have."
- The funnel math is brutal: 100 people see your post, 10 click, 1 clicks the CTA, 0.5 complete the action — which rounds to zero. "A lot of you send 100 people to your stuff and then nothing happens."

Pick the easiest person to sell to. The word "can" creates a fatally wide net. The word "need" creates focus. Who already needs this and requires the least convincing?

**Steps:** Name five specific humans you will personally message on launch day. Go straight to them instead of pushing a thousand through a leaky funnel. Have genuine one-on-one conversations — learn about their situation, then present a solution if you have one.

**Example:** BuildSpace's first users came from college CS Discord groups. They built relationships with 100+ moderators, each group yielding ~35 users. They went straight to where their people already were. "Still a hard game to play actually, but that's how we got 3,500 people."

## The Pre-Launch Checklist

Before you launch, three things must be true:

- **Bio congruence:** Your social bio states what you do in the simplest possible terms. Your feed reinforces it. "This is not the place to be creative." If someone lands on your profile after seeing your product, they understand who you are instantly.
- **Value prop clarity:** You can state what your product does in one sentence a stranger would understand. Clear first. Meaningful second. Persuasive third. If it's not clear, nothing else matters.
- **Five named targets:** Not "post on Twitter and hope." Five specific humans you will personally contact. DM, email, call.

Start building your audience now, while still working on your project. The audience travels with you even if the project changes. "They're following you for the journey, not the destination."

## Experiment Tempo

Two-to-three-day cycles. Not two-week expeditions. Parkinson's Law meets Pareto: give yourself two days instead of two weeks, focus on the 20% that drives 80% of impact.

- "Everyone's looking for a silver bullet. It simply does not exist. You just have to try a bunch of shit."

**Steps:** Run your first experiment in two days. Measure. Kill it or double down. Run the next one. Your launch week should contain at least two distinct experiments, not one big bang.

**Example:** Naveed at Unriddle ran every growth tactic in rapid succession — landing pages, email scraping, influencer outreach, Reddit ads, affiliate marketing, Discord posts. Most experiments took two to three days max. He found TikTok influencers worked: one video hit 600K views and doubled his MRR from $2K to $4K over a weekend. He found the answer by trying everything fast, not by planning the perfect experiment.
