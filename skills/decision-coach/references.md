# Decision Coach — Reference Frameworks

Source material from buildspace Fundamental Lectures. Use these frameworks, quotes, and examples when running the skill workflows.

## Calibration Not Binary

Pivoting is not a binary between "change everything" and "change nothing." It is a spectrum of adjustment sizes — tiny, small, medium, large, complete reinvention. "In reality, what is calibrating? It's actually just a bunch of mini pivots." Most builders fail by either changing too little (grinding at something broken) or too much (whiplashing between directions). The skill is making the right size adjustment.

**Example — Sharif/Lexica:** Spent two years on DeBuild taking steps he later described as "too small every week." Trapped in a local minimum. Then made Lexica — changed his entire company in a week. Millions of users in a month. He needed the large jump because small steps had optimized him into a dead end.

## Upside/Downside Framing

Use upside/downside, not pros/cons. Pros/cons feel concrete and definitive. Upside/downside acknowledges uncertainty — you are estimating best-case and worst-case, not cataloging facts.

**Example — Kat DJing:** Worried about embarrassing herself DJing a party. Upside: pushing comfort zone, networking, real feedback. Downside: potential embarrassment. The upside dominated. "We are our own harshest critics — the things we fear will be embarrassing rarely register with others."

**Example — Ryan's clothing brand:** At $25/shirt he needs 160 sales to hit $4K. At $500/jacket he needs 8. The math doesn't just validate — it redirects.

## Emotional vs Logical

Many builders rationalize emotional decisions with logical-sounding justifications. The principle is not that emotional decisions are wrong — it is that you must know why you are making them. "If you make an emotional decision and it works, great. If it fails, at least you know impatience led you astray, not a flaw in your strategy."

**The two-day break test:** The speaker experienced this repeatedly over 20 years — asking "should I quit?" The reality many times: just needing a two-day break, after which everything felt fine again.

## Do the Math

Put actual numbers to it at orders of magnitude. You do not need precision — is this a $100K idea or a $10M idea? Five to ten minutes of math is enough. Think in probability-weighted terms: a 100% chance of $100K and a 10% chance of $10M are both "$100K in expected value" — but they feel very different.

**Quote:** "If you're thinking about a decision and a day or two goes by, it's unlikely you're going to create a new condition out of thin air." Decide fast.

## Hold Strongly, Hold Loosely

What you hold strongly is your core conviction — the deep reason you are building. What you hold loosely is the specific execution. The conviction stays constant; the implementation pivots freely.

**Example — Ali (legal AI):** Holds strongly: "I want to make really great AI technology for lawyers." Holds loosely: "It's a product that helps lawyers make arguments." The product form can change completely.

**Example — Nyati (emotional wellness):** Holds strongly: helping people connect with emotions. Holds loosely: 20-30 second short-form content. Could be long-form, a therapist network, events — the medium should be held loosely.

## Local Minimum

The neural network analogy: you might be optimized in your local valley, but there is a much deeper global minimum you cannot see. If all you do is take small steps, you optimize within your local valley but never escape it. Sometimes you need a larger step to jump to new territory, then resume calibrating.

**Quote:** "Your goal shouldn't be right. It should just be really good at not being wrong."

**Pattern:** Many small steps with diminishing returns is the signal. The fix is not more tiny adjustments — it is a larger jump.

## On-Season / Off-Season

Two types of focus. **Type One (on-season):** locked in on a clear milestone, relentless execution, not questioning the goal. Nolan on set for three months. Kobe in the fourth quarter. **Type Two (off-season):** deliberate play, training, testing limits. Nolan spending four years on the Oppenheimer script. Kobe practicing specific shots after a loss.

**Quote:** "It's unrealistic to be on all the time. Because my feeling is that you have emotions and you have limits that you don't even know yet and you'll probably break down."

**Patience vs waiting:** "Patience means you've done something and you're awaiting the result. Waiting means you're sitting around hoping something will happen." If they are patient, stay the course. If they are waiting, call it out.

## The Scoreboard

One clear metric. Every decision filtered through: "Does this impact the scoreboard right now?" If not, it is a later problem. Your product is a river blocked by boulders — every week you can move one. The A-plus problem is the biggest boulder you can actually move. Everything else is noise.

**Quote:** "If you play 48 minutes of basketball and look up at the end to find no scoreboard, who won? Nobody knows."

**The Neil Gaiman feedback principle:** "When people tell you something is wrong, they're almost always right. When they tell you exactly what's wrong, they're almost always wrong."
