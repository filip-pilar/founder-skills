# User Conversation References

Specific frameworks, quotes, and stories to use when coaching users on talking to their audience.

## Understand First, Sell Second

**The car salesman story.** Farza's father sold cars at a Nissan dealership in Miami for 25+ years and consistently ranked number one in his region. His method: he never tried to sell anything. He spent 10-20 minutes genuinely understanding the person — their family, their life, their situation. Only then would he make an offer he felt would be good for them. The other salespeople delivered scripted pitches like walking advertisements and got polite declines. "It almost felt like these salespeople were delivering an IRL ad, like in person."

**The party mental model.** Imagine greeting someone at the door of a party with genuine warmth — a wave, a high five, welcome in. Now imagine: "Scan the QR code, go to the back, pay me, authenticate with Google." Your first interaction with a user should feel like the first version, not the second.

**The 96 Civic framing.** "Your goal is not to pretend like you sell a Mercedes. It's to find the people that are down to rock the 96 Civic that you have." Do not pretend your early-stage product is polished. Find people who are genuinely interested in where you are headed.

**One-on-one as superpower.** Large companies cannot give users their individual time. You can. People engage with your early product because they enjoy the conversation with you, not because the product is amazing yet.

## Interpreting Feedback

**The Neil Gaiman principle.** "When people tell you something is wrong, they are almost always right. When they tell you exactly what is wrong, they are almost always wrong." Trust the complaint. Doubt the proposed fix. Users are excellent at identifying pain and terrible at designing solutions.

**Think in ratios.** If you are 80% confident in a conclusion from user feedback, that means one out of five times this conclusion is wrong. "If there was a 20% chance I could get hit by a car crossing the street, is anyone crossing the street here?" Carry the risk alongside the conviction. Do not inflate your certainty.

**The neural network analogy.** "Your goal should not be right. It should just be really good at not being wrong." You are training your product through iteration. Each conversation reduces your loss curve. You never reach zero (perfection), but you get progressively better at not being wrong.

## Finding Users

**The Bebo burritos story.** The Bebo team needed teenagers to test their mobile app. They bought Chipotle burritos and stood in a San Francisco mall with a sign: "Free burritos if you try my app." Mall security kicked them out in five minutes. They moved to a sidewalk outside a high school. Got a teacher to let them into a classroom — and discovered every student had a cracked, low-end phone while the team had been building on the latest iPhones with fast Wi-Fi. That single learning was worth more than weeks of internal discussion. They fixed the problems in one week and went back.

**The AI teddy bear playground story.** Someone building an AI teddy bear was told to go find users. Where are kids? Playgrounds. He found parents at the playground and pitched them. Go where your users physically are.

**Pick the easiest person to sell to.** Not your dream customer. Who requires the least push? If you have been trying to reach one audience for weeks with no response, try an adjacent audience that is easier to reach. BuildSpace learned this the hard way — they built a tool for college students, tried selling to universities (6-12 month contracts) and students (no money). "We picked the hardest people in the world to sell to."

**The 50% rejection rate.** "If you're not getting no's, you're not doing it enough. You should target 50% no's as a ratio." A 50% rejection rate means you are reaching broadly enough and not just talking to your friends.

## Building Relationships

**Close the loop fast.** When someone helps you or gives you feedback, come back within a day showing them what you did with it. The result does not have to be good. It just has to exist. "You will never annoy a person with results, no matter good, no matter bad, ever."

**Help is a relationship, not a transaction.** Nobody sets out to help you. Real help happens when you create the conditions for it — write the newsletter, send the update, share the struggle. Someone responds. You close the loop. The relationship compounds.

## The Practice of Seeking

**Go direct.** Find the person who is two to three steps ahead of you — not 20 steps, not unreachable figures — and make a specific ask. "You're not trying to find people that are gonna save your project. You're trying to find people that are gonna help you in a very pointed way."

**The Furkan story.** Three years of weekly Wednesday calls, started from a single blog post on Medium and a warm DM. Farza shared everything — experiments, emotional breakdowns, wins, losses. Furkan gave blunt feedback weekly. The relationship evolved from mentorship to brotherhood. It worked because Farza was constantly thinking about Furkan's experience: "How can I be the type of person I would want to help?"

**Create surface area for connection.** Write a newsletter, post updates, share what you are working on. Give people the opportunity to find you and choose to help. Sean Puri replied to Farza's newsletter with five words — "Good luck bro. Let me know if I can help" — and changed his trajectory over 30 emails and 10-20 phone calls.

**"If the right people are not coming to you, go find them."** Go see where they are at and try to make them notice you. Do not wait for attention to arrive. Seek it with intention based on what you have learned.

**"Worst case they say no."**
