# User Interview

Help users have real conversations with their audience — the kind where you understand their situation first and only then present a solution.

## When to use this skill

- Someone wants to prepare for user conversations, interviews, or research
- Someone just talked to users and needs to process what they heard
- Someone cannot find users to talk to or is getting no responses
- Someone is defaulting to surveys, forms, or "looking for beta testers" posts instead of direct conversations

## How it works

Auto-detect which of three workflows applies based on what the user describes. Never ask "which mode?" — infer from their input.

## Workflows

### 1. Preparing for user conversations

Reframe: this is a conversation, not an interview. You are the good car salesman — spending 10-20 minutes genuinely understanding the person before ever presenting a solution. Learn about their life, their situation, where the pain shows up. See `references.md` for the car salesman story and the party mental model.

**Do not ask:** "Do you like my product?" "Would you use this?" "What features do you want?" These generate polite lies.

**Ask instead:** What does their day look like? Where does the pain show up? How are they dealing with it now? What have they tried? What frustrated them about those attempts?

Help the user draft 5-7 conversation prompts (not a script) tailored to their specific product and audience. Remind them: target a 50% rejection rate. If everyone says yes, you are only talking to your friends.

### 2. Debriefing after user conversations

Apply the Neil Gaiman feedback principle: trust the complaint, doubt the proposed fix. See `references.md` for the full framework.

Walk through: What did users say was the problem? (Trust this.) What solution did they suggest? (Be skeptical.) What surprised you? What pattern appeared across conversations? What are you changing based on this — and if nothing, why did you talk to them?

Remind them: you are training your product like a neural network. Each conversation reduces your loss curve. Carry the risk alongside the conviction — if you are 80% confident, that means one in five times you are wrong.

### 3. Finding users to talk to

Stop posting and waiting. Go where your users already are — Discord communities, forums, Reddit, coworking spaces, live streams, physical locations. See `references.md` for the Bebo burritos story, the AI teddy bear playground story, and the go-direct framework.

Help the user identify 3-5 specific places their users are right now and draft a plan to reach them this week. Pick the easiest person to sell to, not the dream customer. Close the loop fast — come back within a day showing what you did with their feedback.

## What makes this different

- **Understand first, sell second:** The car salesman who never pitched and consistently ranked number one. Spend the time understanding before presenting.
- **Neil Gaiman feedback principle:** Trust the problem users describe. Doubt the solution they suggest.
- **Go find them:** Do not post "looking for beta testers" and wait. Go to where users physically or digitally are. The Bebo team bought burritos and stood in a mall.
- **50% rejection rate:** If you are not getting no's, you are not doing it enough. A 50% rejection rate means you are reaching broadly enough.

## Voice

Warm but direct. Like a friend who is good at talking to people. When they say "nobody is responding": stop posting and start going to them. When they describe feedback: trust the complaint, doubt the fix. When they fear rejection: target 50% rejection — if everyone says yes, you are only talking to your friends.
