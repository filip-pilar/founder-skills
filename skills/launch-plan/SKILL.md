# Launch Week Playbook

## When to use this skill

- User is preparing to launch and needs a pre-launch checklist
- User has a launch date set and needs help with what to post and say
- User just launched to silence or disappointing results and needs a recovery plan
- User is about to blast social media and needs to be redirected to selling first

## How it works

Three conditional workflows, auto-detected from context. Never ask "which mode?" — infer from what the user describes.

## Workflows

### 1. Pre-Launch ("I am about to launch")

The critical reframe: **sell before you market.** You are too small to market. The funnel math is brutal — 100 people see your post, 10 click, 1 clicks the CTA, 0.5 complete the action. That rounds to zero.

Instead of pushing 1,000 through a leaky funnel, go directly to 5 people. Name them. Pick the **easiest person to sell to** — not your dream customer, the one who requires the least push to say yes.

Run the **congruence check** before launch day. This is a launch readiness gate:
- Does your bio pass the party test? If someone asked "what do you do?" would your bio answer clearly? "This is not the place to be creative."
- Does your landing page match your bio?
- Does your feed reinforce both?

If these three are not aligned, fix them before you launch. Then plan your first 48 hours of content — launch day, day after, day after that. Do not wing it.

### 2. Launch Content ("I need help with what to post")

Draft the launch post using the **transformation narrative**: your audience has a "before" state and your product takes them to an "after" state. Make the transformation obvious — Apple "Shot on iPhone" shows it, Samsung "108 megapixels" doesn't.

Draft DMs to warm contacts using the **party mental model** — greet them at the door with genuine warmth, not "scan the QR code, go to the back, pay me." Learn about their situation first.

Plan the first 48 hours: one concept per post, strong hooks in the first seconds, mix of timeless and trending content. Cross-post as **variable lottery tickets** — Reddit, niche forums, Discord communities, short-form clips. Each additional post is another ticket.

### 3. Post-Launch Recovery ("It flopped")

Diagnose: was it a marketing problem or a selling problem? If you posted on social media and waited, you marketed. You are too small to market. Did you actually talk to 5 people directly?

Did you pick the easiest person? Or did you aim at your dream customer? Consider an adjacent, easier audience. "Your goal is not to pretend you sell a Mercedes — it's to find the people that are down to rock the 96 Civic that you have."

Apply the **experiment framework**: change one variable, keep everything else constant, run a 2-3 day experiment, set a kill criterion before you start. If the right people are not coming to you, go where they are — communities, live streams, forums, Discord servers.

## What makes this different

- **Sell-before-market sequence**: Most people market when they should sell. This skill enforces selling first.
- **Direct-conversation-first**: 5 specific humans before any public post. Go to them instead of pushing 1,000 through a funnel.
- **Congruence check as launch gate**: Bio, landing page, and feed must align before launch day. No launching with a broken front door.
- **First-48-hours playbook**: Concrete content plan for launch day through day three. No winging it.
