# Launch Week Playbook — Reference Material

## Sell Before You Market

The single most important reframe for launch week. **Marketing** is building an audience for your work — mass distribution. **Selling** is getting someone to actually take the action you want. At the early stage, you are too small to market.

**The funnel math that destroys you:** "100 people see your tweet, 10 click through, 1 clicks the CTA, 0.5 complete the action." That rounds to zero. Even at 1,000 people, you get roughly 5 who complete the action. "A lot of you send 100 people to your stuff and then nothing happens and you're like, wow, nothing happened. Why? Well, it's because the math is against you."

The alternative: "If your goal is to get five people to take action, why not go directly to those five people?"

Social media posting is playing a free lottery — keep doing it, play every day. "But don't let that be your strategy. That's not a strategy to sell."

**Pick the easiest person to sell to.** Not your dream customer, not the hardest enterprise sale. BuildSpace learned this the hard way — they tried selling a cloud IDE to universities (6-12 month contracts) and students (no money). "We picked the hardest people in the world to sell to." The lesson: you choose who you sell to, and you can always adjust to make it easier.

## The Direct Conversation

Your superpower at the early stage is one-on-one time. Large companies can't do this. You can.

**The car salesman story:** Farza's father sold cars at a Nissan dealership for 25+ years, consistently ranking #1 in his region. He never pitched, never pushed a product. He spent 10-20 minutes understanding the person — their family, their life, their situation. Only then, if it made sense, he'd suggest something. The other salespeople delivered scripted pitches: "We have a package that gives you leather seats for just $1,000 more." The replies were always awkward deflections. "It almost felt like these salespeople were delivering an IRL ad, like in person."

**The party mental model:** Imagine greeting someone at the door of a party — waving, giving them a high five, welcoming them in with genuine warmth. Now imagine the alternative: they arrive at the door and see "scan the QR code," then "go to the back," then "pay me." Instead of all that, just greet them at the door.

On one-on-one calls: your goal is not to sell them anything, and your goal isn't to become their best friend. It's somewhere in the middle. You learn about their life, their situation. Then at the end, present a solution if you have one.

**The 96 Civic:** "Your goal is not to pretend like you sell a Mercedes. It's to find the people that are down to rock the 96 Civic that you have." Pretending to sell something polished when your product is early-stage is exhausting and dishonest. Finding people who are genuinely interested in where you're headed is the real work.

## Congruence Check

The launch readiness gate. Three things must align before you go live:

1. **Bio** — State what you do in the simplest possible terms. Run the party test: if someone met you at a party and asked what you do, would your bio answer that clearly? "This is not the place to be creative." Examples that fail: "Delusion is the solution," "Walking along the pathless path." Examples that work: "Graphic designer, open for commissions," "Music producer," "Learn from history's greatest entrepreneurs."
2. **Landing page** — Must match the bio. If your bio says you build X, your landing page should clearly show X.
3. **Feed** — Every post should reinforce the bio. If Rohit's bio says he's building a film school, his feed should show teaching, filmmaking tips, student results — not random meme content.

"Everything needs to be hyper-focused." Bio and feed must point in the same direction. If they don't, fix this before launch day.

## Launch Content

**The transformation narrative:** Your audience has a "before" state and your product takes them to an "after" state. Make it obvious. Samsung advertised "108 megapixels" — a spec that tells you nothing. Apple's "Shot on iPhone" shows breathtaking photos taken by real people. Viewers immediately feel "I could take pictures like that." No specs needed.

**Hooks:** The first few seconds matter most. Give context to a new viewer immediately. The hook gives someone who has never seen you a reason not to scroll away.

**One concept per post.** If you have three ideas, make three posts. When you cram too much in, the viewer can't remember what you said.

**Variable lottery tickets:** Cross-post to Reddit, niche forums, Discord communities, short-form clips. Each additional post is another lottery ticket at near-zero marginal cost.

## Post-Launch Recovery

**Diagnosis first:** Was it a marketing problem or a selling problem? If you posted on social media and waited, you marketed. And you are too small to market. Go back to the 5 direct conversations.

**Experiment framework:** Change one variable per experiment. Keep everything else constant. Run it for 2-3 days. Set a kill criterion before you start. "Everyone's looking for a silver bullet. It simply does not exist. You just have to try a bunch of shit."

**Go find your users.** BuildSpace's origin: they discovered their first users were in college CS Discord groups. They leaned in — creating college-themed landing pages for individual universities, building relationships with 100+ Discord moderators. Each group averaged 35 users. "Still a hard game to play actually, but that's how we got 3,500 people to first sign up." They went straight to where their people already were.

**Focus on inputs over outputs.** You can't control whether your graph goes up. You can control what you put into the game. "It's very easy to get caught up in the idea that you're flatline or you're going down or you're flopping. I don't know. It's just one graph."
